PUBIC HAIR


Pubic hair is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans. 

The hair is located on and around the sex organs and sometimes at the top of the inside of the thighs. 

In the pubic region around the pubis bone, it is known as a pubic patch. 

Pubic hair is also found on the scrotum in the male and on the vulva in the female.

Although fine vellus hair is present in the area in childhood, pubic hair is considered to be the heavier, longer and coarser hair that develops during puberty as an effect of rising levels of androgens in males and estrogens in females. 

Pubic hair differs from other hair on the body and is a secondary sex characteristic. 

Many cultures regard pubic hair as erotic, and in most cultures it is associated with the genitals, which both men and women are expected to keep covered at all times. 

In some cultures, it is the norm for pubic hair to be removed, especially of females; the practice is regarded as part of personal hygiene. 

In other cultures, the exposure of pubic hair (for example, when wearing a swimsuit) may be regarded as unaesthetic or embarrassing and is therefore trimmed or otherwise styled to avoid it being visible. 


== Development ==


Pubic hair forms in response to the increasing levels of testosterone in both girls and boys. 

Those hair follicles that are located and stimulated in androgen sensitive areas develop pubic hair. 

The Tanner scale describes and quantifies the development of pubic hair. 

Before the onset of puberty, the genital area of both boys and girls has very fine vellus hair (stage 1). 

At the onset of puberty, the body produces rising levels of the sex hormones, and in response, the skin of the genital area begins to produce thicker and rougher, often curlier, hair with a faster growth rate. 

The onset of pubic hair development is termed pubarche.

In males, the first pubic hair appears as a few sparse hairs that are usually thin on the scrotum or at the upper base of the penis (stage 2). 

Within a year, hairs around the base of the penis are abundant (stage 3). 

Within 3 to 4 years, hair fills the pubic area (stage 4) and becomes much thicker and darker, and by 5 years extends to the near thighs and upwards on the abdomen toward the umbilicus (stage 5).

Other areas of the skin are similarly, though slightly less, sensitive to androgens and androgenic hair typically appears somewhat later. 

In rough sequence of sensitivity to androgens and appearance of androgenic hair, are the armpits (axillae), perianal area, upper lip, preauricular areas (sideburns), periareolar areas (nipples), middle of the chest, neck under the chin, remainder of chest and beard area, limbs and shoulders, back, and buttocks. 

Although generally considered part of the process of puberty, pubarche is distinct and independent of the process of maturation of the gonads that leads to sexual maturation and fertility. 

Pubic hair can develop from adrenal androgens alone and can develop even when the ovaries or testes are defective and nonfunctional. 

There is little, if any, difference in the capacity of male and female bodies to grow hair in response to androgens.

Pubic hair and underarm hair can vary in color considerably from the hair of the scalp. 

In most people, it is darker, although it can also be lighter. 

In most cases it is most similar in color to a person's eyebrows.Hair texture varies from tightly curled to entirely straight, not necessarily correlating to the texture of the scalp hair. 

People of East Asian heritage tend to have straight, wavy pubic hair.Pubic hair patterns can vary by race and ethnicity. 

Patterns of pubic hair, known as the escutcheon, vary between sexes. 

On most females, the pubic patch is triangular and lies over the vulva and mons pubis. 

On many males, the pubic patch tapers upwards to a line of hair pointing towards the navel (see abdominal hair), roughly a more upward-pointing triangle. 

As with axillary (armpit) hair, pubic hair is associated with a concentration of sebaceous glands in the area.


== Clinical significance ==

=== Pubic lice ===

Pubic hair can become infested with pubic lice (also known as crab lice). 

Adult pubic lice are 1.1–1.8 millimetres (0.043–0.071 in) in length. 

The pubic hair can usually host up to a dozen on average. 

Pubic lice are usually found attached to hair in the pubic area but sometimes are found on coarse hair elsewhere on the body (for example, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, chest, armpits, etc.). 

Crab lice attach to pubic hair that is thicker than other body hair because their claws are adapted to the specific diameter of pubic hair. 

Pubic lice infestations (pthiriasis) are usually spread through sexual contact.
The crab louse can travel up to 10 inches on the body. 

Pubic lice infestation is found worldwide and occurs in all races and ethnic groups and in all economic levels. 

Pubic lice are usually spread through sexual contact and are most common in adults. 

Occasionally pubic lice may be spread by close personal contact or contact with articles such as clothing, bed linens, and towels that have been used by an infested person. 

Pubic lice found on the head or eyelashes of children may be an indication of sexual exposure or abuse. 

Pubic lice do not transmit disease; however, secondary bacterial infection can occur from scratching of the skin. 

They are much broader in comparison to head and body lice. 

Adults are found only on the human host and require human blood to survive. 

If adults are forced off the host, they will die within 24–48 hours without a blood feeding.Symptoms of a crab louse infection in the pubic area is intense itching, redness and inflammation. 

These symptoms cause increased circulation to the skin of the pubic region creating a blood-rich environment for the crab louse. 

Pubic lice infestation can also be diagnosed by identifying the presence of nits or eggs on the pubic hair. 

In December 2016 NPR reported that "Frequent removal of pubic hair is associated with an increased risk for herpes, syphilis and human papillomavirus". 

However, the medical community has also seen a recent increase in folliculitis, or infection around the hair follicle, in women who wax or shave their bikini areas. 

Some of these infections can develop into more serious abscesses that require incision with a scalpel, drainage of the abscess, and antibiotics. 

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of folliculitis. 

Burns can result when depilatory wax is used, even according to manufacturer instructions.


=== Grooming ===

Pubic hair grooming has been associated with injury and infection. 

It is estimated that about 1/4 groomers have had at least one lifetime injury due to pubic hair grooming. 

Grooming has also been associated with cutaneous sexually transmitted diseases, such as genital warts, syphilis, and herpes.


== Society and culture ==

According to John Ruskin's biographer Mary Lutyens, the notable author, artist, and art critic was apparently accustomed only to the hairless nudes portrayed unrealistically in art, never having seen a naked woman before his wedding night. 

He was allegedly so shocked by his discovery of his wife Effie's pubic hair that he rejected her, and the marriage was later legally annulled. 

He is supposed to have thought his wife was freakish and deformed. 

Later writers have often followed Lutyens and repeated this version of events. 

For example, Gene Weingarten in his book I'm with Stupid (2004) writes that "Ruskin had [the marriage] annulled because he was horrified to behold upon his bride a thatch of hair, rough and wild, similar to a man's. 

He thought her a monster." However, there is no proof for this, and some disagree. 

Peter Fuller in his book Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace writes, "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood." Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also believe that menstruation is the more likely explanation.

At puberty, many girls find the sudden sprouting of pubic hair disturbing, and sometimes as unclean, because in many cases young girls have been screened by their family and by society from the sight of pubic hair. 

Young boys, on the other hand, tend not to be similarly disturbed by the development of their pubic hair, usually having seen body hair on their fathers.

A United States study by Alfred Kinsey found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of the participants said that there was "seldom" nudity in the home, 3% said "often", and 17% said that it was "usual". 

The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.

In a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect. 

Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.

With the reintroduction of public beaches and pools bathing in Western Europe and the Mediterranean early in the 20th century, exposure of both sexes' areas near their pubic hair became more common, and after the progressive reduction in the size of female and male swimsuits, especially since the coming into fashion and growth in popularity of the bikini after the 1940s, the practice of shaving or bikini waxing of pubic hair off the hem lines also came into vogue.


=== Grooming ===


In some Middle Eastern societies, removal of male and female body hair has been considered proper hygiene, mandated by local customs, for many centuries. 

Muslim teaching includes Islamic hygienical jurisprudence in which pubic and armpit hair must be pulled out or shaven to be considered as Sunnah. 

Trimming is taught to be considered acceptable.According to feminist writer Caitlin Moran, the reason for the removal of pubic hair from women in pornography was a matter of "technical considerations of cinematography". 

Hair removal progressed to full removal. 

Because of the popularity of pornography, pubic hair shaving was mimicked by women.The presentation is regarded by some as being erotic and aesthetic, while others consider the style as unnatural. 

Some people remove pubic hairs for erotic and sexual reasons or because they or their sex partner enjoy the feel of a hairless crotch.

		
==== Methods ====

All hair can be removed with wax formulated for that purpose. 

Some individuals may remove part or all of their pubic hair, axillary hair and facial hair. 

Pubic hair removal using wax is bikini waxing. 

The method of removing hair is called depilation (when removing only the hair above the skin) or epilation (when removing the entire hair). 

Beauty salons often offer various waxing services. 

It is sometimes referred to as "pubic topiary".

Some women modify their pubic hair, either to fit in with societal trends or as an expression of their own style or lifestyle. 

Styles of pubic hair modification include:

Triangle or American wax (pubic hair is shortened from the sides to form a triangle so that pubic hair is hidden while wearing swimwear. 

The triangle can range from the very edge of the "bikini line" to up to an inch reduction on either side. 

Remaining hair length can be from an inch and a half to half an inch);
Landing strip/French wax (pubic hair removed except for a strip of hair extending from the abdomen to the vulva);
Partial Brazilian wax (pubic hair fully removed except for a small triangular strip);
Full Brazilian wax or "sphinx" (complete removal of pubic hair); and
Freestyle.There are variations of the Brazilian wax in which a design is formed out of the pubic hair. 

Stencils for several shapes are available commercially. 

A controversial Gucci commercial included female pubic hair shaved into a 'G'.

		
=== In art ===


In ancient Egyptian art, female pubic hair is indicated in the form of painted triangles. 

In medieval and classical European art, pubic hair was very rarely depicted, and male pubic hair was often, but not always, omitted. 

Sometimes it was portrayed in stylized form, as was the case with Greek graphic art.In 16th century southern Europe, Michelangelo showed the male David with stylized pubic hair, but female bodies were depicted hairless below the head. 

Nevertheless, Michelangelo's male nudes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling display no pubic hair.In the late 18th century, female pubic hair was openly portrayed in Japanese shunga (erotica), especially in the ukiyo-e tradition. 

Hokusai's picture The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife (1814), which depicts a woman having an erotic fantasy, is a well-known example. 

In Japanese drawings, such as hentai, pubic hair is often omitted, since for a long time the display of pubic hair was not legal. 

The interpretation of the law has since changed.


=== In history ===

Evidence of pubic hair removal in ancient India is thought to date back to 4000 to 3000 BC. 

According to ethnologist F. 

Fawcett, writing in 1901, he had observed the removal of body hair, including pubic hair about the vulva, as a custom of women from the Hindu Nair caste.

In Western societies, after the spread of Christianity, public exposure of a woman's bare skin between the ankle and waist started to be disapproved of culturally. 

Upper body exposure due to the use of the popular vest bodices used in Western Europe from the 15th century to early 20th century, as the widespread dirndls used even in more traditionally conservative mountain areas and the more or less loose shirts under these, enabled a permissive view of the shoulders, décolletage and arms allowing a free exposure of upper body hair in women of all classes with less rejection or discrimination than body hair on the sex organs, obviously to conceal by implication. 

Many people came to consider public exposure of pubic hair to be embarrassing. 

It may be regarded as immodest and sometimes as obscene. 

However, it never came to have a full hold in Western culture in wide tracts of Central Europe, until the encroaching of Protestantism during the 16th century on formerly more tolerant customs.

In the 1450s, British prostitutes shaved their pubic hair for purposes of personal hygiene and the combatting of pubic lice and would don merkins (or pubic wigs) when their line of work required it.

Among the British upper classes during the Georgian era, pubic hair from one's lover was frequently collected as a souvenir. 

The curls were, for instance, worn like cockades in men's hats as potency talismans or exchanged among lovers as tokens of affection. 

The museum of St. 

Andrews University in Scotland has in its collection a snuffbox full of pubic hair of one of King George IV's mistresses (possibly Elizabeth Conyngham), which the notoriously licentious monarch donated to the Fife sex club, The Beggar's Benison.


=== In literature ===

In the erotic novel My Secret Life the narrator "Walter", an evident connoisseur of female pubic hair, talks with clear delight of a fine bush of a Scotswoman's thick red pubic hair:

"The bush was long and thick, twisting and curling in masses half-way up to her navel, and it spread about up her buttocks, gradually getting shorter there."

In another part of his autobiography Walter remarks that he has seen those "bare of hair, those with but hairy stubble, those with bushes six inches long, covering them from bum bone to navel."

And he adds reflectively – "there is not much that I have not seen, felt or tried, with respect to this supreme female article."

In like vein, in The Memoirs of Dolly Morton, an American erotic classic, the attributes of Miss Dean are noted with some surprise – her spot was covered with a "thick forest of glossy dark brown hair," with locks nearly two inches long. 

One man remarked,

"But Gosh! I've never seen such a fleece between a woman's legs in my life. 

Darn me if she wouldn't have to be sheared before man could get into her."

VELLO PÚBICO


El vello púbico es el vello corporal terminal que se encuentra en el área genital de los humanos adolescentes y adultos.

El vello se encuentra sobre y alrededor de los órganos sexuales y, a veces, en la parte superior del interior de los muslos.

En la región púbica alrededor del hueso del pubis, se conoce como parche púbico.

El vello púbico también se encuentra en el escroto en el hombre y en la vulva en la mujer.

Aunque el vello velloso fino está presente en el área durante la infancia, el vello púbico se considera el vello más pesado, largo y grueso que se desarrolla durante la pubertad como efecto del aumento de los niveles de andrógenos en los hombres y de estrógenos en las mujeres. 

El vello púbico se diferencia de otros vellos del cuerpo y es una característica sexual secundaria. 

Muchas culturas consideran que el vello púbico es erótico, y en la mayoría de las culturas se asocia con los genitales, que tanto hombres como mujeres deben mantener cubiertos en todo momento. 

En algunas culturas, la norma es eliminar el vello púbico, especialmente en las mujeres; la práctica se considera parte de la higiene personal.

En otras culturas, la exposición del vello púbico (por ejemplo, cuando se usa un traje de baño) puede considerarse antiestético o vergonzoso y, por lo tanto, se recorta o se peina de otra manera para evitar que sea visible. 


== Desarrollo ==


El vello púbico se forma en respuesta al aumento de los niveles de testosterona tanto en niñas como en niños.

Los folículos pilosos que se ubican y estimulan en áreas sensibles a los andrógenos desarrollan vello púbico.

La escala de Tanner describe y cuantifica el desarrollo del vello púbico.

Antes del inicio de la pubertad, el área genital de niños y niñas tiene vello muy fino (etapa 1).

Al comienzo de la pubertad, el cuerpo produce niveles crecientes de hormonas sexuales y, en respuesta, la piel del área genital comienza a producir cabello más grueso y áspero, a menudo más rizado, con una tasa de crecimiento más rápida.

El inicio del desarrollo del vello púbico se denomina pubarquia.

En los hombres, el primer vello púbico aparece como unos pocos vellos escasos que suelen ser delgados en el escroto o en la base superior del pene (etapa 2).

Dentro de un año, los pelos alrededor de la base del pene son abundantes (etapa 3).

Dentro de 3 a 4 años, el vello llena el área púbica (etapa 4) y se vuelve mucho más grueso y oscuro, y a los 5 años se extiende hasta cerca de los muslos y hacia arriba en el abdomen hacia el ombligo (etapa 5).

Otras áreas de la piel son igualmente sensibles a los andrógenos, aunque un poco menos, y el vello androgénico suele aparecer un poco más tarde.

En secuencia aproximada de sensibilidad a los andrógenos y aparición de vello androgénico, se encuentran las axilas (axilas), zona perianal, labio superior, zonas preauriculares (patillas), zonas periareolares (pezones), centro del pecho, cuello bajo la barbilla, resto de área del pecho y la barba, extremidades y hombros, espalda y glúteos.

Aunque generalmente se considera parte del proceso de la pubertad, la pubarquia es distinta e independiente del proceso de maduración de las gónadas que conduce a la madurez sexual y la fertilidad.

El vello púbico puede desarrollarse solo a partir de los andrógenos suprarrenales y puede desarrollarse incluso cuando los ovarios o los testículos son defectuosos y no funcionan.

Hay poca o ninguna diferencia en la capacidad de los cuerpos masculino y femenino para hacer crecer el cabello en respuesta a los andrógenos.

El vello púbico y el vello de las axilas pueden variar considerablemente en color del cabello del cuero cabelludo.

En la mayoría de las personas es más oscuro, aunque también puede ser más claro.

En la mayoría de los casos, el color es más similar al de las cejas de una persona. La textura del cabello varía de muy rizado a completamente liso, lo que no necesariamente se correlaciona con la textura del cabello del cuero cabelludo.

Las personas de origen asiático oriental tienden a tener vello púbico liso y ondulado. Los patrones de vello púbico pueden variar según la raza y el origen étnico.

Los patrones de vello púbico, conocidos como escudo, varían entre sexos.

En la mayoría de las mujeres, el parche púbico es triangular y se encuentra sobre la vulva y el monte de Venus. 

En muchos hombres, el parche púbico se estrecha hacia arriba hasta convertirse en una línea de vello que apunta hacia el ombligo (ver vello abdominal), más o menos un triángulo que apunta hacia arriba. 

Al igual que con el vello axilar (axila), el vello púbico está asociado con una concentración de glándulas sebáceas en el área.


== Importancia clínica ==

=== Piojos púbicos ===

El vello púbico puede infectarse con piojos púbicos (también conocidos como piojos del cangrejo). 

Los piojos púbicos adultos miden de 1,1 a 1,8 milímetros (0,043 a 0,071 pulgadas) de largo. 

El vello púbico suele albergar hasta una docena de media. 

Los piojos púbicos generalmente se encuentran adheridos al cabello en el área púbica, pero a veces se encuentran en el cabello grueso en otras partes del cuerpo (por ejemplo, cejas, pestañas, barba, bigote, pecho, axilas, etc.). 

Los piojos del cangrejo se adhieren al vello púbico que es más grueso que el resto del vello corporal porque sus garras están adaptadas al diámetro específico del vello púbico. 

Las infestaciones de piojos púbicos (ptiriasis) generalmente se transmiten a través del contacto sexual.
El piojo del cangrejo puede viajar hasta 10 pulgadas en el cuerpo. 

La infestación de piojos púbicos se encuentra en todo el mundo y ocurre en todas las razas y grupos étnicos y en todos los niveles económicos. 

Los piojos púbicos generalmente se transmiten a través del contacto sexual y son más comunes en adultos. 

Ocasionalmente, los piojos púbicos pueden propagarse por contacto personal cercano o contacto con artículos como ropa, ropa de cama y toallas que haya usado una persona infestada. 

Los piojos púbicos que se encuentran en la cabeza o las pestañas de los niños pueden ser una indicación de exposición o abuso sexual. 

Los piojos púbicos no transmiten enfermedades; sin embargo, puede ocurrir una infección bacteriana secundaria al rascarse la piel.

Son mucho más amplios en comparación con los piojos de la cabeza y el cuerpo. 

Los adultos se encuentran solo en el huésped humano y requieren sangre humana para sobrevivir. 

Si los adultos son expulsados ​​del huésped, morirán dentro de las 24 a 48 horas sin una alimentación de sangre. Los síntomas de una infección por piojos del cangrejo en el área púbica son picazón intensa, enrojecimiento e inflamación. 

Estos síntomas provocan un aumento de la circulación en la piel de la región púbica creando un ambiente rico en sangre para el piojo del cangrejo. 

La infestación de piojos púbicos también se puede diagnosticar identificando la presencia de liendres o huevos en el vello púbico. 

En diciembre de 2016, NPR informó que "la eliminación frecuente del vello púbico está asociada con un mayor riesgo de herpes, sífilis y virus del papiloma humano". 

Sin embargo, la comunidad médica también ha visto un aumento reciente en la foliculitis, o infección alrededor del folículo piloso, en mujeres que se depilan o afeitan el área del bikini.

Algunas de estas infecciones pueden convertirse en abscesos más graves que requieren incisión con bisturí, drenaje del absceso y antibióticos.

Staphylococcus aureus es la causa más común de foliculitis.

Se pueden producir quemaduras cuando se usa cera depilatoria, incluso de acuerdo con las instrucciones del fabricante.


=== Aseo ===

El cuidado del vello púbico se ha asociado con lesiones e infecciones.

Se estima que alrededor de 1/4 de los peluqueros han tenido al menos una lesión en su vida debido al arreglo del vello púbico.

El aseo también se ha asociado con enfermedades cutáneas de transmisión sexual, como verrugas genitales, sífilis y herpes.


== Sociedad y cultura ==

Según la biógrafa de John Ruskin, Mary Lutyens, el notable autor, artista y crítico de arte aparentemente solo estaba acostumbrado a los desnudos sin pelo representados de manera poco realista en el arte, y nunca había visto a una mujer desnuda antes de su noche de bodas.

Supuestamente, estaba tan sorprendido por el descubrimiento del vello púbico de su esposa Effie que la rechazó y el matrimonio fue anulado legalmente más tarde.

Se supone que pensó que su esposa era rara y deforme.

Los escritores posteriores a menudo han seguido a Lutyens y han repetido esta versión de los hechos.

Por ejemplo, Gene Weingarten en su libro I'm with Stupid (2004) escribe que "Ruskin anuló [el matrimonio] porque estaba horrorizado al ver en su novia una mata de cabello, áspero y salvaje, similar al de un hombre.

Él pensó que ella era un monstruo." Sin embargo, no hay pruebas para esto, y algunos no están de acuerdo.

Peter Fuller en su libro Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace escribe: "Se ha dicho que la noche de bodas se asustó al ver el vello púbico de su esposa; más probablemente, estaba perturbado por su sangre menstrual". Los biógrafos de Ruskin, Tim Hilton y John Batchelor, también creen que la menstruación es la explicación más probable.

En la pubertad, a muchas niñas les inquieta el brote repentino de vello púbico y, a veces, les parece sucio, porque en muchos casos la familia y la sociedad han protegido a las jóvenes de la vista del vello púbico. 

Los niños pequeños, por otro lado, tienden a no verse perturbados de manera similar por el desarrollo de su vello púbico, ya que generalmente han visto vello corporal en sus padres.

Un estudio estadounidense realizado por Alfred Kinsey encontró que el 75 % de los participantes afirmaron que nunca hubo desnudez en el hogar cuando eran niños, el 5 % de los participantes dijo que "rara vez" hubo desnudez en el hogar, el 3 % dijo " a menudo", y el 17% dijo que era "habitual". 

El estudio encontró que no había una diferencia significativa entre lo que informaron los hombres y las mujeres con respecto a la frecuencia de la desnudez en el hogar.

En una revisión de la literatura de 1995, Paul Okami concluyó que no había evidencia confiable que vinculara la exposición a la desnudez de los padres con algún efecto negativo. 

Tres años más tarde, su equipo terminó un estudio longitudinal de 18 años que mostró que, en todo caso, dicha exposición se asoció con leves efectos beneficiosos, particularmente para los niños.

Con la reintroducción de las playas y piscinas públicas para bañarse en Europa Occidental y el Mediterráneo a principios del siglo XX, la exposición de las zonas cercanas al vello púbico de ambos sexos se hizo más común, y tras la reducción progresiva de la talla de los bañadores femeninos y masculinos, especialmente Desde la puesta de moda y el crecimiento de la popularidad del bikini después de la década de 1940, también se puso de moda la práctica de afeitarse o depilarse el vello púbico de las líneas del dobladillo.


=== Aseo ===


En algunas sociedades del Medio Oriente, la eliminación del vello corporal masculino y femenino se ha considerado una higiene adecuada, exigida por las costumbres locales, durante muchos siglos. 

La enseñanza musulmana incluye la jurisprudencia higiénica islámica en la que se debe arrancar o afeitar el vello púbico y de las axilas para que se considere Sunnah. 

Se enseña que el recorte se considera aceptable. Según la escritora feminista Caitlin Moran, el motivo de la eliminación del vello púbico de las mujeres en la pornografía era una cuestión de "consideraciones técnicas de la cinematografía". 

La depilación progresó hasta la eliminación completa. 

Debido a la popularidad de la pornografía, las mujeres imitaron el afeitado del vello púbico. Algunos consideran que la presentación es erótica y estética, mientras que otros consideran que el estilo no es natural. 

Algunas personas eliminan el vello púbico por razones eróticas y sexuales o porque ellos o sus parejas sexuales disfrutan de la sensación de una entrepierna sin vello.

 
==== Métodos ====

Todo el vello se puede eliminar con cera formulada para tal fin. 

Algunas personas pueden eliminar parte o todo el vello púbico, el vello axilar y el vello facial. 

La depilación del vello púbico con cera es la depilación del bikini. 

El método para eliminar el vello se denomina depilación (cuando se elimina solo el vello que se encuentra sobre la piel) o depilación (cuando se elimina todo el vello). 

Los salones de belleza a menudo ofrecen varios servicios de depilación. 

A veces se lo denomina "topiario púbico".

Algunas mujeres modifican su vello púbico, ya sea para adaptarse a las tendencias sociales o como expresión de su propio estilo o estilo de vida. 

Los estilos de modificación del vello púbico incluyen:

Triángulo o cera americana (el vello púbico se acorta de los lados para formar un triángulo para que el vello púbico quede oculto mientras se usa traje de baño. 

El triángulo puede variar desde el borde mismo de la "línea del bikini" hasta una reducción de una pulgada en cada lado. 

La longitud restante del cabello puede ser de una pulgada y media a media pulgada);
Pista de aterrizaje/cera francesa (eliminación del vello púbico excepto una tira de vello que se extiende desde el abdomen hasta la vulva);
Cera brasileña parcial (vello púbico eliminado por completo excepto por una pequeña tira triangular);
Cera brasileña completa o "esfinge" (eliminación completa del vello púbico); y
Estilo libre. Existen variaciones de la cera brasileña en las que se forma un diseño a partir del vello púbico.

Las plantillas para varias formas están disponibles comercialmente.

Un controvertido comercial de Gucci incluía vello púbico femenino afeitado en forma de 'G'.

 
=== En el arte ===


En el arte egipcio antiguo, el vello púbico femenino se indica en forma de triángulos pintados.

En el arte europeo medieval y clásico, el vello púbico rara vez se representaba, y el vello púbico masculino a menudo, pero no siempre, se omitía.

A veces se representaba de forma estilizada, como era el caso del arte gráfico griego. En el sur de Europa del siglo XVI, Miguel Ángel mostraba al David masculino con vello púbico estilizado, pero los cuerpos femeninos se representaban sin vello debajo de la cabeza. 

Sin embargo, los desnudos masculinos de Miguel Ángel en el techo de la Capilla Sixtina no muestran vello púbico. A finales del siglo XVIII, el vello púbico femenino se representaba abiertamente en el shunga japonés (erótica), especialmente en la tradición ukiyo-e. 

El cuadro de Hokusai El sueño de la esposa del pescador (1814), que representa a una mujer teniendo una fantasía erótica, es un ejemplo bien conocido. 

En los dibujos japoneses, como el hentai, a menudo se omite el vello púbico, ya que durante mucho tiempo la exhibición de vello púbico no era legal. 

La interpretación de la ley ha cambiado desde entonces.


=== En la historia ===

Se cree que la evidencia de la eliminación del vello púbico en la antigua India data del 4000 al 3000 a. 

Según el etnólogo F. 

Fawcett, escribiendo en 1901, había observado la eliminación del vello corporal, incluido el vello púbico alrededor de la vulva, como una costumbre de las mujeres de la casta hindú Nair.

En las sociedades occidentales, después de la expansión del cristianismo, la exposición pública de la piel desnuda de una mujer entre el tobillo y la cintura comenzó a desaprobarse culturalmente. 

La exposición de la parte superior del cuerpo debido al uso de los corpiños de chaleco populares utilizados en Europa occidental desde el siglo XV hasta principios del siglo XX, ya que los dirndls generalizados utilizados incluso en las zonas montañosas más tradicionalmente conservadoras y las camisas más o menos holgadas debajo de estos, permitieron un permisivo vista de los hombros, escote y brazos que permite una exposición libre del vello de la parte superior del cuerpo en mujeres de todas las clases con menos rechazo o discriminación que el vello corporal en los órganos sexuales, obviamente para ocultar por implicación.

Mucha gente llegó a considerar vergonzosa la exposición pública del vello púbico.

Puede considerarse inmodesto y, a veces, obsceno.

Sin embargo, nunca llegó a tener un dominio completo en la cultura occidental en amplias zonas de Europa Central, hasta la invasión del protestantismo durante el siglo XVI en costumbres anteriormente más tolerantes.

En la década de 1450, las prostitutas británicas se afeitaban el vello púbico con fines de higiene personal y para combatir los piojos púbicos y se ponían merkins (o pelucas púbicas) cuando su línea de trabajo lo requería.

Entre las clases altas británicas durante la era georgiana, el vello púbico de la amante se coleccionaba con frecuencia como recuerdo.

Los rizos, por ejemplo, se usaban como escarapelas en los sombreros de los hombres como talismanes de potencia o se intercambiaban entre amantes como muestras de afecto.

El museo de St.

La Universidad Andrews en Escocia tiene en su colección una caja de rapé llena de vello púbico de una de las amantes del rey Jorge IV (posiblemente Elizabeth Conyngham), que el monarca notoriamente licencioso donó al club de sexo de Fife, The Beggar's Benison.


=== En la literatura ===

En la novela erótica Mi vida secreta el narrador "Walter", un evidente conocedor del vello púbico femenino, habla con claro deleite de una fina mata de espeso vello púbico rojo de una escocesa:

"El arbusto era largo y grueso, se retorcía y se enroscaba en masas hasta la mitad de su ombligo, y se extendía por sus nalgas, acortándose gradualmente allí".

En otra parte de su autobiografía, Walter comenta que ha visto a los "desnudos de pelo, a los que tienen solo una barba peluda, a los que tienen arbustos de seis pulgadas de largo, cubriéndolos desde el trasero hasta el ombligo".

Y agrega reflexivamente: "no hay mucho que no haya visto, sentido o probado, con respecto a este supremo artículo femenino".

De manera similar, en Las memorias de Dolly Morton, un clásico erótico estadounidense, los atributos de la señorita Dean se notan con cierta sorpresa: su lugar estaba cubierto con un "bosque espeso de cabello castaño oscuro brillante", con mechones de casi dos pulgadas de largo.

Un hombre comentó,

"¡Pero, Dios mío! Nunca en mi vida había visto semejante vellón entre las piernas de una mujer.

Maldita sea si no tendría que ser esquilada antes de que el hombre pudiera entrar en ella".

POILS PUBIENS


Les poils pubiens sont des poils terminaux qui se trouvent dans la région génitale des humains adolescents et adultes.

Les poils sont situés sur et autour des organes sexuels et parfois au sommet de l'intérieur des cuisses.

Dans la région pubienne autour de l'os du pubis, on parle de patch pubien.

Les poils pubiens se trouvent également sur le scrotum chez le mâle et sur la vulve chez la femelle.

Bien que des poils fins de vellus soient présents dans la région pendant l'enfance, les poils pubiens sont considérés comme les poils les plus lourds, les plus longs et les plus grossiers qui se développent pendant la puberté en raison de l'augmentation des niveaux d'androgènes chez les hommes et d'œstrogènes chez les femmes.

Les poils pubiens diffèrent des autres poils du corps et constituent une caractéristique sexuelle secondaire.

De nombreuses cultures considèrent les poils pubiens comme érotiques et, dans la plupart des cultures, ils sont associés aux organes génitaux, que les hommes et les femmes doivent garder couverts à tout moment. 

Dans certaines cultures, c'est la norme d'enlever les poils pubiens, en particulier chez les femmes; la pratique est considérée comme faisant partie de l'hygiène personnelle.

Dans d'autres cultures, l'exposition des poils pubiens (par exemple, lors du port d'un maillot de bain) peut être considérée comme inesthétique ou gênante et est donc coupée ou coiffée d'une autre manière pour éviter qu'elle ne soit visible. 


== Développement ==


Les poils pubiens se forment en réponse à l'augmentation des niveaux de testostérone chez les filles et les garçons. 

Les follicules pileux situés et stimulés dans les zones sensibles aux androgènes développent des poils pubiens. 

L'échelle de Tanner décrit et quantifie le développement des poils pubiens. 

Avant le début de la puberté, la région génitale des garçons et des filles a des poils de vellus très fins (stade 1). 

Au début de la puberté, le corps produit des niveaux croissants d'hormones sexuelles et, en réponse, la peau de la région génitale commence à produire des cheveux plus épais et plus rugueux, souvent plus bouclés, avec un taux de croissance plus rapide. 

Le début du développement des poils pubiens est appelé pubarche.

Chez les hommes, les premiers poils pubiens apparaissent sous la forme de quelques poils clairsemés qui sont généralement fins sur le scrotum ou à la base supérieure du pénis (stade 2). 

En un an, les poils autour de la base du pénis sont abondants (stade 3). 

Dans les 3 à 4 ans, les poils remplissent la région pubienne (stade 4) et deviennent beaucoup plus épais et plus foncés, et à 5 ans s'étendent jusqu'aux cuisses proches et vers le haut sur l'abdomen vers l'ombilic (stade 5).

D'autres zones de la peau sont également, bien que légèrement moins, sensibles aux androgènes et les poils androgènes apparaissent généralement un peu plus tard. 

Dans une séquence approximative de sensibilité aux androgènes et d'apparition de poils androgènes, on trouve les aisselles (aisselles), la zone périanale, la lèvre supérieure, les zones préauriculaires (favoris), les zones périaréolaires (mamelons), le milieu de la poitrine, le cou sous le menton, le reste de la poitrine et la barbe, les membres et les épaules, le dos et les fesses. 

Bien que généralement considérée comme faisant partie du processus de la puberté, la pubarche est distincte et indépendante du processus de maturation des gonades qui conduit à la maturation sexuelle et à la fertilité. 

Les poils pubiens peuvent se développer uniquement à partir des androgènes surrénaliens et peuvent se développer même lorsque les ovaires ou les testicules sont défectueux et non fonctionnels. 

Il y a peu ou pas de différence dans la capacité des corps masculins et féminins à faire pousser les cheveux en réponse aux androgènes.

Les poils pubiens et les poils des aisselles peuvent varier considérablement en couleur des poils du cuir chevelu.

Chez la plupart des gens, il est plus foncé, bien qu'il puisse aussi être plus clair.

Dans la plupart des cas, sa couleur est la plus similaire à celle des sourcils d'une personne. La texture des cheveux varie de étroitement bouclée à entièrement droite, sans nécessairement correspondre à la texture des cheveux du cuir chevelu.

Les personnes d'origine est-asiatique ont tendance à avoir des poils pubiens droits et ondulés. Les motifs de poils pubiens peuvent varier selon la race et l'origine ethnique.

Les motifs de poils pubiens, connus sous le nom d'écusson, varient selon les sexes.

Chez la plupart des femelles, la tache pubienne est triangulaire et recouvre la vulve et le mons pubis.

Chez de nombreux hommes, la tache pubienne se rétrécit vers le haut en une ligne de poils pointant vers le nombril (voir poils abdominaux), à peu près un triangle plus pointant vers le haut. 

Comme pour les poils axillaires (aisselles), les poils pubiens sont associés à une concentration de glandes sébacées dans la région.


== Signification clinique ==

=== Poux du pubis ===

Les poils pubiens peuvent être infestés de poux du pubis (également connus sous le nom de poux de crabe). 

Les poux du pubis adultes mesurent de 1,1 à 1,8 millimètres (0,043 à 0,071 po) de longueur. 

Les poils pubiens peuvent généralement en héberger jusqu'à une douzaine en moyenne. 

Les poux du pubis se trouvent généralement attachés aux poils dans la région pubienne, mais se retrouvent parfois sur les poils grossiers ailleurs sur le corps (par exemple, les sourcils, les cils, la barbe, la moustache, la poitrine, les aisselles, etc.). 

Les poux de crabe s'attachent aux poils pubiens qui sont plus épais que les autres poils du corps parce que leurs pinces sont adaptées au diamètre spécifique des poils pubiens. 

Les infestations de poux du pubis (pthiriasis) se propagent généralement par contact sexuel.
Le pou du crabe peut parcourir jusqu'à 10 pouces sur le corps. 

L'infestation par les poux du pubis se trouve dans le monde entier et se produit dans toutes les races et groupes ethniques et à tous les niveaux économiques. 

Les poux du pubis se transmettent généralement par contact sexuel et sont plus fréquents chez les adultes. 

Parfois, les poux du pubis peuvent se propager par contact personnel étroit ou par contact avec des articles tels que des vêtements, des draps et des serviettes qui ont été utilisés par une personne infestée. 

Les poux pubiens trouvés sur la tête ou les cils des enfants peuvent être une indication d'exposition ou d'abus sexuels. 

Les poux pubiens ne transmettent pas de maladie; cependant, une infection bactérienne secondaire peut survenir en grattant la peau.

Ils sont beaucoup plus larges que les poux de tête et de corps. 

Les adultes ne se trouvent que sur l'hôte humain et ont besoin de sang humain pour survivre. 

Si les adultes sont chassés de l'hôte, ils mourront dans les 24 à 48 heures sans se nourrir de sang. Les symptômes d'une infection au pou du crabe dans la région pubienne sont des démangeaisons intenses, des rougeurs et une inflammation.

Ces symptômes provoquent une augmentation de la circulation dans la peau de la région pubienne, créant un environnement riche en sang pour le pou du crabe.

L'infestation par les poux du pubis peut également être diagnostiquée en identifiant la présence de lentes ou d'œufs sur les poils pubiens.

En décembre 2016, NPR a rapporté que "l'épilation fréquente des poils pubiens est associée à un risque accru d'herpès, de syphilis et de papillomavirus humain".

Cependant, la communauté médicale a également constaté une augmentation récente de la folliculite, ou infection autour du follicule pileux, chez les femmes qui s'épilent ou se rasent la zone du bikini.

Certaines de ces infections peuvent se transformer en abcès plus graves nécessitant une incision au scalpel, un drainage de l'abcès et des antibiotiques. 

Staphylococcus aureus est la cause la plus fréquente de folliculite. 

Des brûlures peuvent survenir lors de l'utilisation de cire à épiler, même selon les instructions du fabricant.


=== Toilettage ===

Le toilettage des poils pubiens a été associé à des blessures et à des infections. 

On estime qu'environ 1/4 des toiletteurs ont eu au moins une blessure à vie due au toilettage des poils pubiens. 

Le toilettage a également été associé à des maladies cutanées sexuellement transmissibles, telles que les verrues génitales, la syphilis et l'herpès.


== Société et culture ==

Selon la biographe de John Ruskin, Mary Lutyens, le célèbre auteur, artiste et critique d'art n'était apparemment habitué qu'aux nus sans poils représentés de manière irréaliste dans l'art, n'ayant jamais vu de femme nue avant sa nuit de noces.

Il aurait été tellement choqué par sa découverte des poils pubiens de sa femme Effie qu'il l'a rejetée, et le mariage a ensuite été légalement annulé.

Il est censé avoir pensé que sa femme était bizarre et déformée.

Les écrivains ultérieurs ont souvent suivi Lutyens et répété cette version des événements.

Par exemple, Gene Weingarten dans son livre I'm with Stupid (2004) écrit que « Ruskin avait [le mariage] annulé parce qu'il était horrifié de voir sur sa fiancée une touffe de cheveux, rêche et sauvage, semblable à celle d'un homme.

Il la considérait comme un monstre." Cependant, il n'y a aucune preuve de cela, et certains ne sont pas d'accord.

Peter Fuller dans son livre Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace écrit: "On a dit qu'il avait été effrayé la nuit de noces par la vue des poils pubiens de sa femme; plus probablement, il était perturbé par son sang menstruel." Les biographes de Ruskin, Tim Hilton et John Batchelor, pensent également que les menstruations sont l'explication la plus probable.

À la puberté, de nombreuses filles trouvent la pousse soudaine des poils pubiens dérangeante, et parfois aussi impure, car dans de nombreux cas, les jeunes filles ont été protégées par leur famille et par la société de la vue des poils pubiens. 

Les jeunes garçons, en revanche, ont tendance à ne pas être perturbés de la même manière par le développement de leurs poils pubiens, ayant généralement vu des poils sur leur père.

Une étude américaine d'Alfred Kinsey a révélé que 75% des participants ont déclaré qu'il n'y avait jamais de nudité à la maison lorsqu'ils grandissaient, 5% des participants ont déclaré qu'il y avait "rarement" de la nudité à la maison, 3% ont déclaré " souvent », et 17 % ont dit que c'était « habituel ».

L'étude a révélé qu'il n'y avait pas de différence significative entre ce qui était rapporté par les hommes et par les femmes en ce qui concerne la fréquence de la nudité à la maison.

Dans une revue de la littérature de 1995, Paul Okami a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucune preuve fiable reliant l'exposition à la nudité parentale à un effet négatif.

Trois ans plus tard, son équipe a terminé une étude longitudinale de 18 ans qui a montré que, au moins, une telle exposition était associée à de légers effets bénéfiques, en particulier pour les garçons.

Avec la réintroduction des plages publiques et des piscines de baignade en Europe occidentale et en Méditerranée au début du XXe siècle, l'exposition des zones des deux sexes près de leurs poils pubiens est devenue plus courante, et après la réduction progressive de la taille des maillots de bain féminins et masculins, en particulier depuis l'entrée à la mode et la popularité croissante du bikini après les années 1940, la pratique du rasage ou de l'épilation à la cire du bikini des poils pubiens sur les lignes d'ourlet est également devenue à la mode.


=== Toilettage ===


Dans certaines sociétés du Moyen-Orient, l'épilation des hommes et des femmes est considérée comme une bonne hygiène, imposée par les coutumes locales, depuis de nombreux siècles. 

L'enseignement musulman comprend la jurisprudence hygiénique islamique dans laquelle les poils pubiens et des aisselles doivent être arrachés ou rasés pour être considérés comme de la Sunna. 

On enseigne que la coupe est considérée comme acceptable. Selon l'écrivain féministe Caitlin Moran, la raison de l'épilation des poils pubiens des femmes dans la pornographie était une question de "considérations techniques de la cinématographie".

L'épilation a progressé jusqu'à l'épilation complète.

En raison de la popularité de la pornographie, le rasage des poils pubiens a été imité par les femmes. La présentation est considérée par certains comme étant érotique et esthétique, tandis que d'autres considèrent le style comme non naturel.

Certaines personnes enlèvent les poils pubiens pour des raisons érotiques et sexuelles ou parce qu'elles-mêmes ou leur partenaire sexuel apprécient la sensation d'un entrejambe sans poils.

 
==== Méthodes ====

Tous les poils peuvent être épilés avec une cire formulée à cet effet.

Certaines personnes peuvent enlever une partie ou la totalité de leurs poils pubiens, poils axillaires et poils faciaux.

L'épilation pubienne à la cire est une épilation bikini.

La méthode d'épilation est appelée épilation (en enlevant uniquement les poils au-dessus de la peau) ou épilation (en enlevant tous les poils). 

Les salons de beauté offrent souvent divers services d'épilation. 

Il est parfois appelé "topiaire pubien".

Certaines femmes modifient leurs poils pubiens, soit pour s'adapter aux tendances sociétales, soit pour exprimer leur propre style ou style de vie. 

Les styles de modification des poils pubiens comprennent :

Triangle ou cire américaine (les poils pubiens sont raccourcis sur les côtés pour former un triangle afin que les poils pubiens soient cachés lorsque vous portez des maillots de bain. 

Le triangle peut aller du bord même de la "ligne de bikini" jusqu'à une réduction d'un pouce de chaque côté. 

La longueur restante des cheveux peut aller d'un pouce et demi à un demi-pouce);
Piste d'atterrissage / cire française (poils pubiens enlevés à l'exception d'une bande de poils s'étendant de l'abdomen à la vulve);
Épilation brésilienne partielle (poils pubiens entièrement éliminés à l'exception d'une petite bande triangulaire) ;
Cire brésilienne intégrale ou « sphinx » (épilation complète des poils pubiens) ; et
Freestyle.Il existe des variantes de la cire brésilienne dans lesquelles un dessin est formé à partir des poils pubiens.

Des pochoirs pour plusieurs formes sont disponibles dans le commerce.

Une publicité controversée de Gucci incluait des poils pubiens féminins rasés en «G».

 
=== Dans l'art ===


Dans l'art égyptien antique, les poils pubiens féminins sont indiqués sous la forme de triangles peints.

Dans l'art européen médiéval et classique, les poils pubiens étaient très rarement représentés et les poils pubiens masculins étaient souvent, mais pas toujours, omis.

Parfois, il était représenté sous une forme stylisée, comme c'était le cas avec l'art graphique grec. Dans le sud de l'Europe du XVIe siècle, Michel-Ange montrait le David masculin avec des poils pubiens stylisés, mais les corps féminins étaient représentés sans poils sous la tête.

Néanmoins, les nus masculins de Michel-Ange sur le plafond de la chapelle Sixtine ne présentent aucun poil pubien. À la fin du XVIIIe siècle, les poils pubiens féminins étaient ouvertement représentés dans le shunga japonais (érotique), en particulier dans la tradition ukiyo-e.

Le tableau de Hokusai Le rêve de la femme du pêcheur (1814), qui représente une femme ayant un fantasme érotique, en est un exemple bien connu.

Dans les dessins japonais, comme le hentai, les poils pubiens sont souvent omis, car pendant longtemps l'affichage des poils pubiens n'était pas légal.

L'interprétation de la loi a changé depuis.


=== Dans l'histoire ===

On pense que les preuves d'épilation pubienne dans l'Inde ancienne remontent à 4000 à 3000 av.

Selon l'ethnologue F.

Fawcett, écrivant en 1901, il avait observé l'épilation du corps, y compris les poils pubiens autour de la vulve, comme une coutume des femmes de la caste hindoue Nair.

Dans les sociétés occidentales, après la diffusion du christianisme, l'exposition publique de la peau nue d'une femme entre la cheville et la taille a commencé à être culturellement désapprouvée.

L'exposition du haut du corps en raison de l'utilisation des corsages de gilet populaires utilisés en Europe occidentale du XVe siècle au début du XXe siècle, car les dirndls répandus utilisés même dans les zones de montagne plus traditionnellement conservatrices et les chemises plus ou moins amples sous ceux-ci, ont permis un permissif vue des épaules, du décolleté et des bras permettant une exposition libre des poils du haut du corps chez les femmes de toutes les classes avec moins de rejet ou de discrimination que les poils du corps sur les organes sexuels, évidemment à dissimuler par implication.

Beaucoup de gens en sont venus à considérer l'exposition publique des poils pubiens comme embarrassante.

Cela peut être considéré comme impudique et parfois comme obscène.

Cependant, il ne s'est jamais imposé pleinement dans la culture occidentale dans de vastes étendues d'Europe centrale, jusqu'à l'empiètement du protestantisme au XVIe siècle sur des coutumes autrefois plus tolérantes.

Dans les années 1450, les prostituées britanniques se rasaient les poils pubiens à des fins d'hygiène personnelle et de lutte contre les poux du pubis et enfilaient des merkins (ou perruques pubiennes) lorsque leur métier l'exigeait.

Parmi les classes supérieures britanniques à l'époque géorgienne, les poils pubiens de son amant étaient fréquemment collectés en souvenir.

Les boucles étaient, par exemple, portées comme des cocardes dans les chapeaux d'hommes comme talismans de puissance ou échangées entre amants comme marques d'affection.

Le musée de St.

L'Université Andrews en Écosse a dans sa collection une tabatière pleine de poils pubiens de l'une des maîtresses du roi George IV (peut-être Elizabeth Conyngham), que le monarque notoirement licencieux a fait don au sex club Fife, The Beggar's Benison.


=== Dans la littérature ===

Dans le roman érotique My Secret Life, le narrateur "Walter", un connaisseur évident des poils pubiens féminins, parle avec un plaisir évident d'un fin buisson de poils pubiens rouges épais d'une Écossaise :

"Le buisson était long et épais, se tordait et s'enroulait en masse à mi-chemin jusqu'à son nombril, et il s'étendait jusqu'à ses fesses, devenant progressivement plus court là-bas."

Dans une autre partie de son autobiographie, Walter remarque qu'il a vu ceux "sans cheveux, ceux qui n'ont qu'un chaume poilu, ceux avec des buissons de six pouces de long, les couvrant de l'os du fessier au nombril".

Et il ajoute pensivement - "il n'y a pas grand-chose que je n'ai pas vu, ressenti ou essayé, en ce qui concerne cet article féminin suprême."

Dans la même veine, dans The Memoirs of Dolly Morton, un classique érotique américain, les attributs de Miss Dean sont notés avec une certaine surprise - sa tache était couverte d'une "épaisse forêt de cheveux brun foncé brillant", avec des mèches de près de deux pouces de long.

Un homme a fait remarquer,

"Mais mon Dieu ! Je n'ai jamais vu une telle toison entre les jambes d'une femme de ma vie.

Merde si elle n'aurait pas à être tondue avant que l'homme puisse entrer en elle."

PÊLOS PÚBICOS


Os pêlos pubianos são pêlos terminais do corpo encontrados na área genital de humanos adolescentes e adultos. 

O cabelo está localizado em torno dos órgãos sexuais e, às vezes, na parte superior da parte interna das coxas. 

Na região púbica ao redor do osso púbico, é conhecida como mancha púbica. 

Os pêlos pubianos também são encontrados no escroto no homem e na vulva na mulher.

Embora os pêlos vellus finos estejam presentes na área na infância, os pêlos pubianos são considerados os pêlos mais pesados, longos e grossos que se desenvolvem durante a puberdade como efeito do aumento dos níveis de andrógenos nos homens e de estrogênios nas mulheres. 

Os pêlos pubianos diferem dos outros pêlos do corpo e são uma característica sexual secundária. 

Muitas culturas consideram os pelos pubianos como eróticos e, na maioria das culturas, estão associados aos genitais, que tanto homens quanto mulheres devem manter sempre cobertos.

Em algumas culturas, é normal que os pelos pubianos sejam removidos, especialmente nas mulheres; a prática é considerada como parte da higiene pessoal.

Em outras culturas, a exposição de pêlos pubianos (por exemplo, ao usar um maiô) pode ser considerada inestética ou embaraçosa e, portanto, é aparada ou estilizada para evitar que fique visível.


== Desenvolvimento ==


Os pêlos pubianos se formam em resposta aos níveis crescentes de testosterona em meninas e meninos.

Os folículos pilosos que estão localizados e estimulados em áreas sensíveis aos andrógenos desenvolvem pêlos pubianos.

A escala de Tanner descreve e quantifica o desenvolvimento de pêlos pubianos.

Antes do início da puberdade, a área genital de meninos e meninas tem pêlos muito finos (estágio 1). 

No início da puberdade, o corpo produz níveis crescentes de hormônios sexuais e, em resposta, a pele da área genital começa a produzir cabelos mais grossos e ásperos, muitas vezes mais encaracolados, com uma taxa de crescimento mais rápida. 

O início do desenvolvimento dos pêlos pubianos é denominado pubarca.

Nos homens, os primeiros pêlos pubianos aparecem como alguns pêlos esparsos que geralmente são finos no escroto ou na base superior do pênis (estágio 2). 

Dentro de um ano, os pêlos ao redor da base do pênis são abundantes (estágio 3). 

Dentro de 3 a 4 anos, os pelos preenchem a região pubiana (estágio 4) e tornam-se muito mais espessos e escuros, e em 5 anos se estendem até as coxas e para cima no abdômen em direção ao umbigo (estágio 5).

Outras áreas da pele são semelhantes, embora um pouco menos, sensíveis aos andrógenos e o cabelo androgênico geralmente aparece um pouco mais tarde.

Na sequência aproximada da sensibilidade aos andrógenos e aparecimento dos pelos androgênicos, encontram-se as axilas (axilas), região perianal, lábio superior, regiões pré-auriculares (costelas), regiões periareolares (mamilos), meio do tórax, pescoço sob o queixo, restante do área do peito e barba, membros e ombros, costas e nádegas.

Embora geralmente considerada parte do processo da puberdade, a pubarca é distinta e independente do processo de maturação das gônadas que leva à maturação sexual e à fertilidade.

Os pêlos pubianos podem se desenvolver apenas a partir de andrógenos adrenais e podem se desenvolver mesmo quando os ovários ou testículos são defeituosos e não funcionais.

Há pouca ou nenhuma diferença na capacidade dos corpos masculino e feminino de crescer cabelo em resposta aos andrógenos.

Os pelos pubianos e os pelos das axilas podem variar consideravelmente de cor em relação aos pelos do couro cabeludo. 

Na maioria das pessoas, é mais escuro, embora também possa ser mais claro. 

Na maioria dos casos, é mais semelhante à cor das sobrancelhas de uma pessoa. A textura do cabelo varia de bem enrolado a totalmente reto, não necessariamente correlacionando-se com a textura do cabelo do couro cabeludo. 

As pessoas de herança do leste asiático tendem a ter pêlos pubianos lisos e ondulados. Os padrões de pêlos pubianos podem variar de acordo com a raça e a etnia. 

Padrões de pêlos pubianos, conhecidos como escudo, variam entre os sexos. 

Na maioria das fêmeas, a mancha púbica é triangular e situa-se sobre a vulva e o monte púbico. 

Em muitos machos, a mancha pubiana afunila para cima até uma linha de pelos apontando para o umbigo (ver pelos abdominais), aproximadamente um triângulo apontando para cima.

Tal como acontece com os pêlos axilares (axilas), os pêlos pubianos estão associados a uma concentração de glândulas sebáceas na área.


== Significado clínico ==

=== Piolhos púbicos ===

Os pelos pubianos podem ficar infestados de piolhos púbicos (também conhecidos como piolhos de caranguejo).

Os piolhos púbicos adultos têm 1,1 a 1,8 milímetros (0,043 a 0,071 pol.) de comprimento.

Os pêlos pubianos geralmente podem hospedar até uma dúzia em média.

Os piolhos púbicos geralmente são encontrados presos aos pelos na região pubiana, mas às vezes são encontrados em pelos grossos em outras partes do corpo (por exemplo, sobrancelhas, cílios, barba, bigode, peito, axilas, etc.).

Os piolhos do caranguejo se prendem aos pelos pubianos que são mais grossos do que outros pelos do corpo porque suas garras são adaptadas ao diâmetro específico dos pelos pubianos.

As infestações de piolhos púbicos (ptiríase) geralmente são transmitidas por contato sexual.
O piolho de caranguejo pode viajar até 10 polegadas no corpo.

A infestação por piolhos pubianos é encontrada em todo o mundo e ocorre em todas as raças e grupos étnicos e em todos os níveis econômicos.

Os piolhos pubianos geralmente são transmitidos por contato sexual e são mais comuns em adultos.

Ocasionalmente, os piolhos púbicos podem se espalhar por contato pessoal próximo ou contato com artigos como roupas, roupas de cama e toalhas que foram usadas por uma pessoa infestada.

Piolhos púbicos encontrados na cabeça ou cílios de crianças podem ser uma indicação de exposição ou abuso sexual.

Os piolhos púbicos não transmitem doenças; no entanto, a infecção bacteriana secundária pode ocorrer por coçar a pele.

Eles são muito mais amplos em comparação com os piolhos da cabeça e do corpo.

Os adultos são encontrados apenas no hospedeiro humano e requerem sangue humano para sobreviver.

Se os adultos forem forçados a sair do hospedeiro, eles morrerão dentro de 24 a 48 horas sem uma alimentação de sangue. Os sintomas de uma infecção por piolhos na região pubiana são coceira intensa, vermelhidão e inflamação. 

Esses sintomas causam aumento da circulação na pele da região pubiana, criando um ambiente rico em sangue para o piolho. 

A infestação de piolhos pubianos também pode ser diagnosticada pela identificação da presença de lêndeas ou ovos nos pêlos pubianos. 

Em dezembro de 2016, a NPR informou que "a remoção frequente de pêlos pubianos está associada a um risco aumentado de herpes, sífilis e papilomavírus humano". 

No entanto, a comunidade médica também viu um aumento recente na foliculite, ou infecção ao redor do folículo piloso, em mulheres que depilam ou depilam as áreas do biquíni. 

Algumas dessas infecções podem evoluir para abscessos mais graves que requerem incisão com bisturi, drenagem do abscesso e antibióticos. 

Staphylococcus aureus é a causa mais comum de foliculite. 

Podem ocorrer queimaduras quando a cera depilatória é usada, mesmo de acordo com as instruções do fabricante.


=== Cuidando ===

A limpeza de pelos pubianos tem sido associada a lesões e infecções. 

Estima-se que cerca de 1/4 dos tosadores tiveram pelo menos uma lesão na vida devido à limpeza dos pelos pubianos. 

A higiene também tem sido associada a doenças cutâneas sexualmente transmissíveis, como verrugas genitais, sífilis e herpes.


== Sociedade e cultura ==

De acordo com a biógrafa de John Ruskin, Mary Lutyens, o notável autor, artista e crítico de arte aparentemente estava acostumado apenas aos nus sem pêlos retratados de forma irreal na arte, nunca tendo visto uma mulher nua antes de sua noite de núpcias. 

Ele teria ficado tão chocado com a descoberta dos pêlos pubianos de sua esposa Effie que a rejeitou, e o casamento foi posteriormente anulado legalmente. 

Ele deve ter pensado que sua esposa era esquisita e deformada. 

Escritores posteriores muitas vezes seguiram Lutyens e repetiram essa versão dos eventos. 

Por exemplo, Gene Weingarten em seu livro I'm with Stupid (2004) escreve que "Ruskin teve [o casamento] anulado porque ficou horrorizado ao ver em sua noiva um tufo de cabelo, áspero e selvagem, semelhante ao de um homem. 

Ele a achava um monstro." No entanto, não há provas para isso, e alguns discordam. 

Peter Fuller em seu livro Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace escreve: "Foi dito que ele ficou assustado na noite de núpcias com a visão dos pêlos pubianos de sua esposa; mais provavelmente, ele foi perturbado pelo sangue menstrual dela". Os biógrafos de Ruskin, Tim Hilton e John Batchelor, também acreditam que a menstruação é a explicação mais provável.

Na puberdade, muitas meninas acham o surgimento súbito de pelos pubianos perturbador e, às vezes, impuro, porque em muitos casos as meninas foram protegidas por sua família e pela sociedade da visão de pelos pubianos. 

Os meninos jovens, por outro lado, tendem a não se incomodar da mesma forma com o desenvolvimento de seus pêlos pubianos, geralmente tendo visto pêlos corporais em seus pais.

Um estudo realizado nos Estados Unidos por Alfred Kinsey descobriu que 75% dos participantes afirmaram que nunca havia nudez em casa quando estavam crescendo, 5% dos participantes disseram que havia "raramente" nudez em casa, 3% disseram " frequentemente", e 17% disseram que era "habitual". 

O estudo constatou que não houve diferença significativa entre o que foi relatado por homens e por mulheres com relação à frequência de nudez em casa.

Em uma revisão da literatura de 1995, Paul Okami concluiu que não havia evidências confiáveis ​​ligando a exposição à nudez dos pais a qualquer efeito negativo. 

Três anos depois, sua equipe terminou um estudo longitudinal de 18 anos que mostrou que, se alguma coisa, essa exposição estava associada a pequenos efeitos benéficos, principalmente para meninos.

Com a reintrodução de praias e piscinas públicas para banho na Europa Ocidental e no Mediterrâneo no início do século XX, a exposição de ambos os sexos nas áreas próximas aos pelos pubianos tornou-se mais comum e após a redução progressiva do tamanho dos trajes de banho femininos e masculinos, especialmente desde a entrada na moda e o crescimento da popularidade do biquíni após a década de 1940, a prática de barbear ou depilar os pelos pubianos fora das linhas da bainha também entrou em voga.


=== Cuidando ===


Em algumas sociedades do Oriente Médio, a remoção de pelos corporais masculinos e femininos tem sido considerada higiene adequada, exigida pelos costumes locais, por muitos séculos. 

O ensinamento muçulmano inclui a jurisprudência higiênica islâmica na qual os pelos pubianos e nas axilas devem ser arrancados ou raspados para serem considerados Sunnah. 

Aparar é ensinado a ser considerado aceitável. De acordo com a escritora feminista Caitlin Moran, a razão para a remoção de pelos pubianos de mulheres na pornografia era uma questão de "considerações técnicas de cinematografia". 

A depilação progrediu para a remoção total. 

Por causa da popularidade da pornografia, o barbear dos pêlos pubianos foi imitado pelas mulheres. A apresentação é considerada por algumas como erótica e estética, enquanto outras consideram o estilo antinatural. 

Algumas pessoas removem os pelos pubianos por razões eróticas e sexuais ou porque elas ou seu parceiro sexual gostam da sensação de uma virilha sem pelos.

 
==== Métodos ====

Todos os pelos podem ser removidos com cera formulada para esse fim. 

Alguns indivíduos podem remover parte ou todos os pêlos pubianos, pêlos axilares e pêlos faciais. 

A depilação pubiana com cera é a depilação com cera do biquíni. 

O método de remoção de pelos é chamado de depilação (quando remove apenas o cabelo acima da pele) ou depilação (quando remove todo o cabelo).

Os salões de beleza costumam oferecer vários serviços de depilação.

Às vezes é referido como "topiaria púbica".

Algumas mulheres modificam seus pelos pubianos, seja para se adequar às tendências da sociedade ou como expressão de seu próprio estilo ou estilo de vida.

Os estilos de modificação dos pelos pubianos incluem:

Triângulo ou cera americana (os pêlos pubianos são encurtados dos lados para formar um triângulo para que os pêlos pubianos fiquem escondidos ao usar roupas de banho.

O triângulo pode variar desde a borda da "linha do biquíni" até uma redução de até uma polegada em ambos os lados.

O comprimento restante do cabelo pode ser de uma polegada e meia a meia polegada);
Pista de aterrissagem/cera francesa (pelos pubianos removidos, exceto uma faixa de pelos que se estende do abdômen até a vulva);
Cera brasileira parcial (pelos pubianos totalmente removidos, exceto por uma pequena faixa triangular);
Cera brasileira completa ou "esfinge" (remoção completa dos pelos pubianos); e
Freestyle. Existem variações da cera brasileira em que um desenho é formado a partir dos pelos pubianos. 

Estênceis para várias formas estão disponíveis comercialmente. 

Um controverso comercial da Gucci incluiu pêlos pubianos femininos raspados em um 'G'.

 
=== Na arte ===


Na arte egípcia antiga, os pêlos pubianos femininos são indicados na forma de triângulos pintados. 

Na arte medieval e clássica européia, os pêlos pubianos raramente eram representados, e os pêlos pubianos masculinos eram frequentemente, mas nem sempre, omitidos. 

Às vezes, era retratado de forma estilizada, como era o caso da arte gráfica grega. No sul da Europa do século XVI, Michelangelo mostrou o David masculino com pêlos pubianos estilizados, mas os corpos femininos eram retratados sem pêlos abaixo da cabeça.

No entanto, os nus masculinos de Michelangelo no teto da Capela Sistina não exibem pelos pubianos.

O quadro de Hokusai O sonho da esposa do pescador (1814), que retrata uma mulher tendo uma fantasia erótica, é um exemplo bem conhecido.

Nos desenhos japoneses, como o hentai, os pêlos pubianos são frequentemente omitidos, já que por muito tempo a exibição de pêlos pubianos não era legal.

A interpretação da lei mudou desde então.


=== Na história ===

Acredita-se que as evidências de depilação pubiana na Índia antiga datam de 4.000 a 3.000 aC.

Segundo o etnólogo F.

Fawcett, escrevendo em 1901, ele havia observado a remoção de pêlos do corpo, incluindo pêlos pubianos sobre a vulva, como um costume das mulheres da casta hindu Nair.

Nas sociedades ocidentais, após a disseminação do cristianismo, a exposição pública da pele nua de uma mulher entre o tornozelo e a cintura começou a ser desaprovada culturalmente.

A exposição da parte superior do corpo devido ao uso dos populares corpetes de colete usados ​​na Europa Ocidental desde o século 15 até o início do século 20, como os dirndls difundidos usados ​​​​mesmo nas áreas de montanha mais tradicionalmente conservadoras e as camisas mais ou menos soltas sob estes, permitiram uma exposição permissiva vista dos ombros, decote e braços permitindo uma exposição livre de pêlos na parte superior do corpo em mulheres de todas as classes com menos rejeição ou discriminação do que pêlos do corpo nos órgãos sexuais, obviamente para ocultar por implicação.

Muitas pessoas passaram a considerar a exposição pública de pêlos pubianos constrangedora.

Pode ser considerado imodesto e às vezes obsceno.

No entanto, nunca chegou a ter um domínio completo na cultura ocidental em amplas áreas da Europa Central, até a invasão do protestantismo durante o século 16 em costumes anteriormente mais tolerantes.

Na década de 1450, as prostitutas britânicas raspavam os pelos pubianos para fins de higiene pessoal e combate aos piolhos pubianos e usavam merkins (ou perucas pubianas) quando sua linha de trabalho exigia.

Entre as classes altas britânicas durante a era georgiana, os pêlos pubianos do amante eram frequentemente coletados como lembrança.

Os cachos eram, por exemplo, usados ​​como cocares em chapéus masculinos como talismãs de potência ou trocados entre amantes como símbolos de afeto.

O museu de S.

A Universidade Andrews, na Escócia, tem em sua coleção uma caixa de rapé cheia de pelos pubianos de uma das amantes do rei George IV (possivelmente Elizabeth Conyngham), que o monarca notoriamente licencioso doou ao clube de sexo Fife, The Beggar's Benison.


=== Na literatura ===

No romance erótico My Secret Life, o narrador "Walter", um evidente conhecedor de pêlos pubianos femininos, fala com claro deleite de um fino arbusto de pêlos pubianos ruivos e grossos de uma escocesa:

"O arbusto era longo e grosso, torcendo e enrolando em massas até a metade do umbigo, e se espalhava pelas nádegas, gradualmente ficando mais curto lá."

Em outra parte de sua autobiografia, Walter observa que viu aqueles "pelados despidos, aqueles com apenas barba por fazer, aqueles com arbustos de quinze centímetros de comprimento, cobrindo-os do osso do bumbum ao umbigo".

E acrescenta reflexivamente – “não há muito que eu não tenha visto, sentido ou experimentado, em relação a este artigo feminino supremo”.

Da mesma forma, em The Memoirs of Dolly Morton, um clássico erótico americano, os atributos de Miss Dean são notados com alguma surpresa – seu lugar estava coberto com uma “espessa floresta de cabelos castanhos escuros brilhantes”, com mechas de quase cinco centímetros de comprimento.

Um homem comentou,

"Mas Deus! Eu nunca vi uma lã entre as pernas de uma mulher na minha vida.

Maldito seja se ela não tivesse que ser tosquiada antes que o homem pudesse entrar nela."
