URINARY BLADDER


The urinary bladder, or simply bladder, is a hollow muscular organ in humans and other vertebrates that stores urine from the kidneys before disposal by urination. 

In humans the bladder is a hollow distensible organ that sits on the pelvic floor. 

Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. 

The typical human bladder will hold between 300 and 500 ml before the urge to empty occurs, but can hold considerably more.

The Latin phrase for "urinary bladder" is vesica urinaria, and the term vesical or prefix vesico - appear in connection with associated structures such as vesical veins. 

The modern Latin word for "bladder" – cystis – appears in associated terms such as cystitis (inflammation of the bladder).


== Structure ==


In humans, the bladder is a hollow muscular organ situated at the base of the pelvis. 

In gross anatomy, the bladder can be divided into a broad fundus, a body, an apex, and a neck. 

The apex is directed forward toward the upper part of the pubic symphysis, and from there the median umbilical ligament continues upward on the back of the anterior abdominal wall to the umbilicus. 

The peritoneum is carried by it from the apex on to the abdominal wall to form the middle umbilical fold. 

The neck of the bladder is the area at the base of the trigone that surrounds the internal urethral orifice that leads to the urethra. 

In males the neck of the urinary bladder is next to the prostate gland.
The bladder has three openings. 

The two ureters enter the bladder at ureteric orifices, and the urethra enters at the trigone of the bladder. 

These ureteric openings have mucosal flaps in front of them that act as valves in preventing the backflow of urine into the ureters, known as vesicoureteral reflux. 

Between the two ureteric openings is a raised area of tissue called the interureteric crest. 

This makes the upper boundary of the trigone. 

The trigone is an area of smooth muscle that forms the floor of the bladder above the urethra. 

It is an area of smooth tissue for the easy flow of urine into and from this part of the bladder - in contrast to the irregular surface formed by the rugae.

The walls of the bladder have a series of ridges, thick mucosal folds known as rugae that allow for the expansion of the bladder. 

The detrusor muscle is the muscular layer of the wall made of smooth muscle fibers arranged in spiral, longitudinal, and circular bundles. 

The detrusor muscle is able to change its length. 

It can also contract for a long time whilst voiding, and it stays relaxed whilst the bladder is filling. 

The wall of the urinary bladder is normally 3–5 mm thick. 

When well distended, the wall is normally less than 3 mm.


=== Nearby structures ===


In men, the prostate gland lies outside the opening for the urethra. 

The middle lobe of the prostate causes an elevation in the mucous membrane behind the internal urethral orifice called the uvula of urinary bladder. 

The uvula can enlarge when the prostate becomes enlarged.
The bladder is located below the peritoneal cavity near the pelvic floor and behind the pubic symphysis. 

In men, it lies in front of the rectum, separated by the recto-vesical pouch, and is supported by fibres of the levator ani and of the prostate gland. 

In women, it lies in front of the uterus, separated by the vesico-uterine pouch, and is supported by the elevator ani and the upper part of the vagina.


=== Blood and lymph supply ===

The bladder receives blood by the vesical arteries and drained into a network of vesical veins. 

The superior vesical artery supplies blood to the upper part of the bladder. 

The lower part of the bladder is supplied by the inferior vesical artery, both of which are branches of the internal iliac arteries. 

In females, the uterine and vaginal arteries provide additional blood supply. 

Venous drainage begins in a network of small vessels on the lower lateral surfaces of the bladder, which coalesce and travel with the lateral ligaments of the bladder into the internal iliac veins.

The lymph drained from the bladder begins in a series of networks throughout the mucosal, muscular and serosal layers. 

These then form three sets of vessels: one set near the trigone draining the bottom of the bladder; one set draining the top of the bladder; and another set draining the outer undersurface of the bladder. 

The majority of these vessels drain into the external iliac lymph nodes.


=== Nerve supply ===

The bladder receives both sensory and motor supply from sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. 

The motor supply from both sympathetic fibers, most of which arise from the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses and nerves, and from parasympathetic fibers, which come from the pelvic splanchnic nerves.Sensation from the bladder, relating to distension or to irritation (such as by infection or a stone) is transmitted primarily through the parasympathetic nervous system. 

These travel via sacral nerves to S2-4. 

From here, sensation travels to the brain via the dorsal columns in the spinal cord.


=== Microanatomy ===

When viewed under a microscope the bladder can be seen to have an inner lining (called epithelium), three layers of muscle fibres, and an outer adventitia.

The inner wall of the bladder is called urothelium, a type of transitional epithelium formed by three to six layers of cells; the cells may become more cuboidal or flatter depending on whether the bladder is empty or full. 

Additionally, these are lined with a mucous membrane consisting of a surface glycocalyx that protects the cells beneath it from urine. 

The epithelium lies on a thin basement membrane, and a lamina propria. 

The mucosal lining also offers a urothelial barrier against the passing of infections.

These layers are surrounded by three layers of muscle fibres arranged as an inner layer of fibres orientated longitudinally, a middle layer of circular fibres, and an outermost layer of longitudinal fibres; these form the detrusor muscle, which can be seen with the naked eye.The outside of the bladder is protected by a serous membrane called adventitia.



=== Development ===


In the developing embryo, at the hind end lies a cloaca. 

This, over the fourth to the seventh week, divides into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings of the anal canal, with a wall forming between these two inpouchings called the urorectal septum. 

The urogenital sinus divides into three parts, with the upper and largest part becoming the bladder; the middle part becoming the urethra, and the lower part changes depending on the biological sex of the embryo.The human urinary bladder derives from the urogenital sinus, and it is initially continuous with the allantois. 

The upper and lower parts of the bladder develop separately and join together around the middle part of development. 

At this time the ureters move from the mesonephric ducts to the trigone. 

In males, the base of the bladder lies between the rectum and the pubic symphysis. 

It is superior to the prostate, and separated from the rectum by the recto-vesical pouch. 

In females, the bladder sits inferior to the uterus and anterior to the vagina; thus its maximum capacity is lower than in males. 

It is separated from the uterus by the vesico-uterine pouch. 

In infants and young children the urinary bladder is in the abdomen even when empty.


== Function ==


Urine, excreted by the kidneys, collects in the bladder because of drainage from two ureters, before disposal by urination (micturition). 

Urine leaves the bladder via the urethra, a single muscular tube ending in an opening called the urinary meatus, where it exits the body. 

Urination involves coordinated muscle changes involving a reflex based in the spine, with higher inputs from the brain. 

During urination, the detrusor muscle contracts, and the external urinary sphincter and muscles of the perineum relax, allowing urine to pass through the urethra and out of the body.

The urge to pass urine stems from stretch receptors that activate when between 300 - 400 mL urine is held within the bladder. 

As urine accumulates, the rugae flatten and the wall of the bladder thins as it stretches, allowing the bladder to store larger amounts of urine without a significant rise in internal pressure. 

Urination is controlled by the pontine micturition center in the brainstem.Stretch receptors in the bladder signal the parasympathetic nervous system to stimulate the muscarinic receptors in the detrusor to contract the muscle when the bladder is distended. 

This encourages the bladder to expel urine through the urethra. 

The main receptor activated is the M3 receptor, although M2 receptors are also involved and whilst outnumbering the M3 receptors they are not so responsive.

The main relaxant pathway is via the adenylyl cyclase cAMP pathway, activated via the β3 adrenergic receptors. 

The β2 adrenergic receptors are also present in the detrusor and even outnumber β3 receptors, but they do not have as important an effect in relaxing the detrusor smooth muscle.


== Clinical significance ==


=== Inflammation and infection ===


Cystitis refers to infection or inflammation of the bladder. 

It commonly occurs as part of a urinary tract infection. 

In adults, it is more common in women than men, owing to a shorter urethra. 

It is common in males during childhood, and in older men where an enlarged prostate may cause urinary retention. 

Other risk factors include other causes of blockage or narrowing, such as prostate cancer or the presence of vesico-ureteric reflux; the presence of outside structures in the urinary tract, such as urinary catheters; and neurologic problems that make passing urine difficult. 

Infections that involve the bladder can cause pain in the lower abdomen (above the pubic symphysis, so called "suprapubic" pain), particularly before and after passing urine, and a desire to pass urine frequently and with little warning (urinary urgency). 

Infections are usually due to bacteria, of which the most common is E coli.When a urinary tract infection or cystitis is suspected, a medical practitioner may request a urine sample. 

A dipstick placed in the urine may be used to see if the urine has white blood cells, or the presence of nitrates which may indicate an infection. 

The urine specimen may be also sent for microbial culture and sensitivity to assess if a particular bacteria grows in the urine, and identify its antibiotic sensitivities. 

Sometimes, additional investigations may be requested. 

These might include testing the function of the kidneys by assessing electrolytes and creatinine; investigating for blockages or narrowing of the renal tract with a ultrasound, and testing for an enlarged prostate with a digital rectal examination.

Urinary tract infections or cystitis are treated with antibiotics, many of which are consumed by mouth. 

Serious infections may require treatment with intravenous antibiotics.Interstitial cystitis refers to a condition in which the bladder is infected due to a cause that is not bacteria.


=== Incontinence and retention ===

Frequent urination can be due to excessive urine production, small bladder capacity, irritability or incomplete emptying. 

Males with an enlarged prostate urinate more frequently. 

One definition of an overactive bladder is when a person urinates more than eight times per day. 

An overactive bladder can often cause urinary incontinence. 

Though both urinary frequency and volumes have been shown to have a circadian rhythm, meaning day and night cycles, it is not entirely clear how these are disturbed in the overactive bladder. 

Urodynamic testing can help to explain the symptoms. 

An underactive bladder is the condition where there is a difficulty in passing urine and is the main symptom of a neurogenic bladder. 

Frequent urination at night may indicate the presence of bladder stones.
Disorders of or related to the bladder include:

Bladder exstrophy
Bladder sphincter dyssynergia, a condition in which the sufferer cannot coordinate relaxation of the urethra sphincter with the contraction of the bladder muscles
Paruresis
Trigonitis
Urinary retention

Disorders of bladder function may be dealt with surgically, by re-directing the flow of urine or by replacement with an artificial urinary bladder. 

The volume of the bladder may be increased by bladder augmentation. 

An obstruction of the bladder neck may be severe enough to warrant surgery.


=== Cancer ===


Cancer of the bladder is known as bladder cancer. 

It is usually due to cancer of the urothelium, the cells that line the surface of the bladder. 

Bladder cancer is more common after the age of 40, and more common in men than women; other risk factors include smoking and exposure to dyes such as aromatic amines and aldehydes. 

When cancer is present, the most common symptom in an affected person is blood in the urine; a physical medical examination may be otherwise normal, except in late disease. 

Bladder cancer is most often due to cancer of the cells lining the ureter, called transitional cell carcinoma, although it can more rarely occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of cells lining the urethra have changed due to chronic inflammation, such as due to stones or schistosomiasis.

Investigations performed usually include collecting a sample of urine for an inspection for malignant cells under a microscope, called cytology, as well as medical imaging by a CT urogram or ultrasound. 

If a concerning lesion is seen, a flexible camera may be inserted into the bladder, called cystoscopy, in order to view the lesion and take a biopsy, and a CT scan will be performed of other body parts (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis) to look for additional metastatic lesions.Treatment depends on the cancer's stage. 

Cancer present only in the bladder may be removed surgically via cystoscopy; an injection of the chemotherapeutic mitomycin C may be performed at the same time. 

Cancers that are high grade may be treated with an injection of the BCG vaccine into the bladder wall, and may require surgical removal if it does not resolve. 

Cancer that is invading through the bladder wall may be managed by complete surgical removal of the bladder (radical cystectomy), with the ureters diverted into a segment of part of ileum connected to a stoma bag on the skin. 

Prognosis can vary markedly depending on the cancer's stage and grade, with a better prognosis associated with tumours found only in the bladder, that are low grade, that don't invade through the bladder wall, and that is papillary in visual appearance.


=== Investigation ===


A number of investigations are used to examine the bladder. 

The investigations that are ordered will depend on the taking of a medical history and an examination. 

The examination may involve a medical practitioner feeling in the suprapubic area for tenderness or fullness that might indicate an inflamed or full bladder. 

Blood tests may be ordered that may indicate inflammation; for example a full blood count may demonstrate elevated white blood cells, or a C-reactive protein may be elevated in an infection.Some forms of medical imaging exist to visualise the bladder. 

A bladder ultrasound may be conducted to view how much urine is within the bladder, indicating urinary retention. 

A urinary tract ultrasound, conducted by a more trained operator, may be conducted to view whether there are stones, tumours or sites of obstruction within the bladder and urinary tract. 

A CT scan may also be ordered.
A flexible internal camera, called a cystoscope, can be inserted to view the internal appearance of the bladder and take a biopsy if required.
Urodynamic testing can help to explain the symptoms.


== Other animals ==


=== Mammals ===

All mammals have a urinary bladder. 

This structure begins as an embryonic cloaca. 

In the vast majority, this eventually becomes differentiated into a dorsal part connected to the intestine and a ventral part which becomes associated with the urinogenital passage and urinary bladder. 

The only mammals in which this does not take place are the platypus and the spiny anteater both of which retain the cloaca into adulthood.The mammalian bladder is an organ that regularly stores a hyperosmotic concentration of urine. 

It therefore is relatively impermeable and has multiple epithelial layers. 

The urinary bladder of the cetaceans (whales and dolphins) is proportionally smaller than that of land-dwelling mammals.


=== Reptiles ===

In all reptiles, the urinogenital ducts and the anus both empty into an organ called a cloaca. 

In some reptiles, a midventral wall in the cloaca may open into a urinary bladder, but not all. 

It is present in all turtles and tortoises as well as most lizards but is lacking in the monitor lizard, the legless lizards. 

It is absent in the snakes, alligators, and crocodiles.: p. 474 Many turtles, tortoises, and lizards have proportionally very large bladders. 

Charles Darwin noted that the Galapagos tortoise had a bladder which could store up to 20% of its body weight. 

Such adaptations are the result of environments such as remote islands and deserts where water is very scarce. 

Other desert-dwelling reptiles have large bladders that can store a long-term reservoir of water for up to several months and aid in osmoregulation.

Turtles have two or more accessory urinary bladders, located lateral to the neck of the urinary bladder and dorsal to the pubis, occupying a significant portion of their body cavity. 

Their bladder is also usually bilobed with a left and right section. 

The right section is located under the liver, which prevents large stones from remaining in that side while the left section is more likely to have calculi.


=== Amphibians ===

Most aquatic and semi-aquatic amphibians have a membranous skin which allows them to absorb water directly through it. 

Some semi-aquatic animals also have similarly permeable bladder membrane. 

As a result, they tend to have high rates of urine production to offset this high water intake, and have urine which is low in dissolved salts. 

The urinary bladder assists such animals to retain salts. 

Some aquatic amphibian such as Xenopus do not reabsorb water, to prevent excessive water influx. 

For land-dwelling amphibians, dehydration results in reduced urine output.The amphibian bladder is usually highly distensible and among some land-dwelling species of frogs and salamanders may account for between 20% and 50% of their total body weight.


=== Fish ===

The gills of most teleost fish help to eliminate ammonia from the body, and fish live surrounded by water, but most still have a distinct bladder for storing waste fluid. 

The urinary bladder of teleosts is permeable to water, though this is less true for freshwater dwelling species than saltwater species.

Most fish also have an organ called a swim-bladder which is unrelated to the urinary bladder except in its membranous nature. 

The loaches, pilchards, and herrings are among the few types of fish in which a urinary bladder is poorly developed. 

It is largest in those fish which lack an air bladder, and is situated in front of the oviducts and behind the rectum.


=== Birds ===


In nearly all bird species, there is no urinary bladder per se. 

Although all birds have kidneys, the ureters open directly into a cloaca which serves as a reservoir for urine, fecal matter, and eggs.


=== Crustaceans ===

Unlike the urinary bladder of vertebrates, the urinary bladder of crustaceans both stores and modifies urine. 

The bladder consists of two sets of lateral and central lobes. 

The central lobes sit near the digestive organs and the lateral lobes extend along the front and sides of the crustacean's body cavity. 

The tissue of the bladder is thin epithelium.

VEJIGA URINARIA


La vejiga urinaria, o simplemente vejiga, es un órgano muscular hueco en humanos y otros vertebrados que almacena la orina de los riñones antes de desecharla mediante la micción.

En los seres humanos, la vejiga es un órgano distensible hueco que se asienta sobre el suelo pélvico.

La orina entra en la vejiga a través de los uréteres y sale por la uretra.

La vejiga humana típica contiene entre 300 y 500 ml antes de que se produzca la urgencia de vaciar, pero puede contener una cantidad considerablemente mayor.

La frase latina para "vejiga urinaria" es vesica urinaria, y el término vesical o prefijo vesico - aparece en relación con estructuras asociadas como las venas vesicales.

La palabra latina moderna para "vejiga" (cistis) aparece en términos asociados como cistitis (inflamación de la vejiga).


== Estructura ==


En los humanos, la vejiga es un órgano muscular hueco situado en la base de la pelvis.

En anatomía macroscópica, la vejiga se puede dividir en un fondo amplio, un cuerpo, un vértice y un cuello.

El vértice se dirige hacia adelante, hacia la parte superior de la sínfisis púbica, y desde allí el ligamento umbilical medio continúa hacia arriba por la parte posterior de la pared abdominal anterior hasta el ombligo.

Lleva el peritoneo desde el vértice hasta la pared abdominal para formar el pliegue umbilical medio. 

El cuello de la vejiga es el área en la base del trígono que rodea el orificio uretral interno que conduce a la uretra. 

En los hombres, el cuello de la vejiga urinaria está al lado de la glándula prostática.
La vejiga tiene tres aberturas. 

Los dos uréteres entran en la vejiga por los orificios ureterales y la uretra entra por el trígono de la vejiga. 

Estas aberturas ureterales tienen colgajos mucosos frente a ellos que actúan como válvulas para evitar el reflujo de orina hacia los uréteres, lo que se conoce como reflujo vesicoureteral. 

Entre las dos aberturas ureterales hay un área elevada de tejido llamada cresta interureteral. 

Esto hace que el límite superior del trígono. 

El trígono es un área de músculo liso que forma el suelo de la vejiga por encima de la uretra. 

Es un área de tejido liso para el fácil flujo de orina hacia y desde esta parte de la vejiga, en contraste con la superficie irregular formada por las rugosidades.

Las paredes de la vejiga tienen una serie de crestas, pliegues mucosos gruesos conocidos como rugosidades que permiten la expansión de la vejiga. 

El músculo detrusor es la capa muscular de la pared formada por fibras musculares lisas dispuestas en haces espirales, longitudinales y circulares. 

El músculo detrusor puede cambiar su longitud. 

También puede contraerse durante mucho tiempo durante la micción y permanece relajado mientras la vejiga se llena. 

La pared de la vejiga urinaria normalmente tiene un grosor de 3 a 5 mm. 

Cuando está bien distendida, la pared normalmente mide menos de 3 mm.


=== Estructuras cercanas ===


En los hombres, la próstata se encuentra fuera de la abertura de la uretra. 

El lóbulo medio de la próstata provoca una elevación de la membrana mucosa detrás del orificio uretral interno llamado úvula de la vejiga urinaria.

La úvula puede agrandarse cuando la próstata se agranda.
La vejiga se encuentra debajo de la cavidad peritoneal cerca del piso pélvico y detrás de la sínfisis púbica.

En los hombres, se encuentra frente al recto, separado por la bolsa recto-vesical, y está sostenido por fibras del elevador del ano y de la glándula prostática.

En las mujeres, se encuentra frente al útero, separado por la bolsa vesicouterina, y está sostenido por el elevador del ano y la parte superior de la vagina.


=== Suministro de sangre y linfa ===

La vejiga recibe sangre de las arterias vesicales y la drena en una red de venas vesicales.

La arteria vesical superior suministra sangre a la parte superior de la vejiga.

La parte inferior de la vejiga está irrigada por la arteria vesical inferior, ambas ramas de las arterias ilíacas internas. 

En las mujeres, las arterias uterina y vaginal proporcionan un suministro de sangre adicional. 

El drenaje venoso comienza en una red de pequeños vasos en las superficies laterales inferiores de la vejiga, que se unen y viajan con los ligamentos laterales de la vejiga hacia las venas ilíacas internas.

La linfa drenada de la vejiga comienza en una serie de redes a lo largo de las capas mucosa, muscular y serosa. 

Estos luego forman tres conjuntos de vasos: uno cerca del trígono que drena el fondo de la vejiga; un juego que drena la parte superior de la vejiga; y otro conjunto que drena la superficie inferior exterior de la vejiga.

La mayoría de estos vasos drenan en los ganglios linfáticos ilíacos externos.


=== Suministro nervioso ===

La vejiga recibe suministro sensorial y motor de los sistemas nerviosos simpático y parasimpático. 

La inervación motora de ambas fibras simpáticas, la mayoría de las cuales surgen de los plexos y nervios hipogástricos superior e inferior, y de las fibras parasimpáticas, que provienen de los nervios esplácnicos pélvicos. Sensación de la vejiga, relacionada con distensión o irritación (como por una infección o un cálculo) se transmite principalmente a través del sistema nervioso parasimpático. 

Estos viajan a través de los nervios sacros a S2-4. 

Desde aquí, la sensación viaja al cerebro a través de las columnas dorsales de la médula espinal.


=== Microanatomía ===

Cuando se observa bajo un microscopio, se puede ver que la vejiga tiene un revestimiento interno (llamado epitelio), tres capas de fibras musculares y una adventicia externa.

La pared interna de la vejiga se llama urotelio, un tipo de epitelio de transición formado por tres a seis capas de células; las células pueden volverse más cúbicas o más planas dependiendo de si la vejiga está vacía o llena.

Además, estos están revestidos con una membrana mucosa que consiste en un glucocáliz superficial que protege a las células debajo de la orina.

El epitelio se encuentra sobre una delgada membrana basal y una lámina propia.

El revestimiento mucoso también ofrece una barrera urotelial contra el paso de infecciones.

Estas capas están rodeadas por tres capas de fibras musculares dispuestas como una capa interna de fibras orientadas longitudinalmente, una capa intermedia de fibras circulares y una capa más externa de fibras longitudinales; estos forman el músculo detrusor, que se puede ver a simple vista. El exterior de la vejiga está protegido por una membrana serosa llamada adventicia.



=== Desarrollo ===


En el embrión en desarrollo, en el extremo posterior se encuentra una cloaca. 

Este, durante la cuarta a la séptima semana, se divide en un seno urogenital y los comienzos del canal anal, con una pared que se forma entre estas dos bolsas llamadas tabique urorrectal. 

El seno urogenital se divide en tres partes, y la parte superior y más grande se convierte en la vejiga; la parte media se convierte en la uretra, y la parte inferior cambia según el sexo biológico del embrión. La vejiga urinaria humana deriva del seno urogenital, y se continúa inicialmente con la alantoides.

Las partes superior e inferior de la vejiga se desarrollan por separado y se unen alrededor de la parte media del desarrollo. 

En este momento, los uréteres se mueven desde los conductos mesonéfricos hasta el trígono. 

En los hombres, la base de la vejiga se encuentra entre el recto y la sínfisis del pubis. 

Es superior a la próstata y está separada del recto por la bolsa recto-vesical. 

En las mujeres, la vejiga se encuentra por debajo del útero y por delante de la vagina; por lo que su capacidad máxima es menor que en los machos.

Está separado del útero por la bolsa vesico-uterina. 

En bebés y niños pequeños, la vejiga urinaria está en el abdomen incluso cuando está vacía.


== Función ==


La orina, excretada por los riñones, se acumula en la vejiga debido al drenaje de dos uréteres, antes de eliminarse mediante la micción (micción). 

La orina sale de la vejiga a través de la uretra, un solo tubo muscular que termina en una abertura llamada meato urinario, por donde sale del cuerpo. 

La micción implica cambios musculares coordinados que involucran un reflejo basado en la columna vertebral, con entradas más altas del cerebro. 

Durante la micción, el músculo detrusor se contrae y el esfínter urinario externo y los músculos del perineo se relajan, lo que permite que la orina pase a través de la uretra y salga del cuerpo.

El impulso de orinar proviene de los receptores de estiramiento que se activan cuando se retienen entre 300 y 400 ml de orina dentro de la vejiga.

A medida que se acumula la orina, las rugosidades se aplanan y la pared de la vejiga se adelgaza a medida que se estira, lo que permite que la vejiga almacene mayores cantidades de orina sin un aumento significativo de la presión interna.

La micción está controlada por el centro pontino de la micción en el tronco encefálico. Los receptores de estiramiento en la vejiga le indican al sistema nervioso parasimpático que estimule los receptores muscarínicos en el detrusor para contraer el músculo cuando la vejiga está distendida.

Esto anima a la vejiga a expulsar la orina a través de la uretra.

El principal receptor activado es el receptor M3, aunque los receptores M2 también están involucrados y, aunque superan en número a los receptores M3, no son tan sensibles.

La principal vía relajante es a través de la vía cAMP de la adenilil ciclasa, activada a través de los receptores adrenérgicos β3.

Los receptores adrenérgicos β2 también están presentes en el detrusor e incluso superan en número a los receptores β3, pero no tienen un efecto tan importante en la relajación del músculo liso del detrusor.


== Importancia clínica ==


=== Inflamación e infección ===


La cistitis se refiere a la infección o inflamación de la vejiga.

Ocurre comúnmente como parte de una infección del tracto urinario.

En adultos, es más común en mujeres que en hombres, debido a una uretra más corta.

Es común en los hombres durante la infancia y en los hombres mayores donde una próstata agrandada puede causar retención urinaria.

Otros factores de riesgo incluyen otras causas de bloqueo o estrechamiento, como el cáncer de próstata o la presencia de reflujo vesico-ureteral; la presencia de estructuras externas en el tracto urinario, como sondas urinarias; y problemas neurológicos que dificultan el paso de la orina.

Las infecciones que involucran la vejiga pueden causar dolor en la parte inferior del abdomen (por encima de la sínfisis púbica, llamado dolor "suprapúbico"), particularmente antes y después de orinar, y un deseo de orinar con frecuencia y sin previo aviso (urgencia urinaria). 

Las infecciones generalmente se deben a bacterias, de las cuales la más común es E coli. Cuando se sospecha una infección del tracto urinario o cistitis, un médico puede solicitar una muestra de orina. 

Se puede usar una tira reactiva colocada en la orina para ver si la orina tiene glóbulos blancos o la presencia de nitratos que pueden indicar una infección. 

La muestra de orina también se puede enviar para cultivo microbiano y sensibilidad para evaluar si una bacteria en particular crece en la orina e identificar su sensibilidad a los antibióticos. 

A veces, se pueden solicitar investigaciones adicionales. 

Estos pueden incluir probar la función de los riñones mediante la evaluación de electrolitos y creatinina; investigar obstrucciones o estrechamiento del tracto renal con un ultrasonido y probar si hay agrandamiento de la próstata con un examen rectal digital.

Las infecciones del tracto urinario o la cistitis se tratan con antibióticos, muchos de los cuales se consumen por vía oral. 

Las infecciones graves pueden requerir tratamiento con antibióticos por vía intravenosa. La cistitis intersticial se refiere a una afección en la que la vejiga se infecta debido a una causa que no son bacterias.


=== Incontinencia y retención ===

La micción frecuente puede deberse a una producción excesiva de orina, una vejiga de poca capacidad, irritabilidad o un vaciamiento incompleto.

Los hombres con próstata agrandada orinan con más frecuencia.

Una definición de vejiga hiperactiva es cuando una persona orina más de ocho veces al día.

Una vejiga hiperactiva a menudo puede causar incontinencia urinaria.

Aunque se ha demostrado que tanto la frecuencia como los volúmenes urinarios tienen un ritmo circadiano, es decir, ciclos diurnos y nocturnos, no está del todo claro cómo se alteran en la vejiga hiperactiva.

Las pruebas urodinámicas pueden ayudar a explicar los síntomas.

Una vejiga hipoactiva es la condición en la que hay dificultad para orinar y es el síntoma principal de una vejiga neurogénica. 

La micción frecuente por la noche puede indicar la presencia de cálculos en la vejiga.
Los trastornos de la vejiga o relacionados con ella incluyen:

Extrofia vesical
Disinergia del esfínter de la vejiga, una afección en la que el paciente no puede coordinar la relajación del esfínter de la uretra con la contracción de los músculos de la vejiga.
paruresis
trigonitis
Retención urinaria

Los trastornos de la función de la vejiga pueden tratarse quirúrgicamente, redirigiendo el flujo de orina o reemplazándolo con una vejiga urinaria artificial. 

El volumen de la vejiga se puede aumentar mediante el aumento de la vejiga. 

Una obstrucción del cuello de la vejiga puede ser lo suficientemente grave como para justificar la cirugía.


=== Cáncer ===


El cáncer de vejiga se conoce como cáncer de vejiga. 

Por lo general, se debe al cáncer del urotelio, las células que recubren la superficie de la vejiga. 

El cáncer de vejiga es más común después de los 40 años y más común en hombres que en mujeres; otros factores de riesgo incluyen fumar y la exposición a colorantes como aminas aromáticas y aldehídos.

Cuando el cáncer está presente, el síntoma más común en una persona afectada es sangre en la orina; un examen médico físico puede ser por lo demás normal, excepto en la enfermedad tardía.

El cáncer de vejiga se debe con mayor frecuencia al cáncer de las células que recubren el uréter, llamado carcinoma de células de transición, aunque puede ocurrir con menos frecuencia como un carcinoma de células escamosas si el tipo de células que recubren la uretra ha cambiado debido a una inflamación crónica, como por cálculos o esquistosomiasis.

Las investigaciones realizadas generalmente incluyen la recolección de una muestra de orina para una inspección de células malignas bajo un microscopio, llamada citología, así como imágenes médicas mediante una urografía por tomografía computarizada o una ecografía.

Si se observa una lesión preocupante, se puede insertar una cámara flexible en la vejiga, llamada cistoscopia, para ver la lesión y tomar una biopsia, y se realizará una tomografía computarizada de otras partes del cuerpo (una tomografía computarizada del tórax, abdomen y pelvis) para buscar lesiones metastásicas adicionales. El tratamiento depende de la etapa del cáncer.

El cáncer presente solo en la vejiga se puede extirpar quirúrgicamente a través de una cistoscopia; al mismo tiempo se puede realizar una inyección de la mitomicina C quimioterapéutica.

Los cánceres de alto grado pueden tratarse con una inyección de la vacuna BCG en la pared de la vejiga y pueden requerir extirpación quirúrgica si no se resuelve.

El cáncer que invade a través de la pared de la vejiga puede tratarse mediante la extirpación quirúrgica completa de la vejiga (cistectomía radical), con los uréteres desviados hacia un segmento de parte del íleon conectado a una bolsa de estoma en la piel. 

El pronóstico puede variar notablemente según la etapa y el grado del cáncer, con un mejor pronóstico asociado con tumores que se encuentran solo en la vejiga, que son de bajo grado, que no invaden a través de la pared de la vejiga y que tienen una apariencia visual papilar.


=== Investigación ===


Se utilizan varias investigaciones para examinar la vejiga. 

Las investigaciones que se ordenen dependerán de la realización de una historia clínica y un examen. 

El examen puede implicar que un médico palpe el área suprapúbica en busca de sensibilidad o plenitud que podría indicar una vejiga inflamada o llena. 

Se pueden ordenar análisis de sangre que pueden indicar inflamación; por ejemplo, un hemograma completo puede mostrar glóbulos blancos elevados, o una proteína C reactiva puede estar elevada en una infección. Existen algunas formas de imágenes médicas para visualizar la vejiga.

Se puede realizar una ecografía de la vejiga para ver cuánta orina hay dentro de la vejiga, lo que indica retención urinaria.

Se puede realizar una ecografía del tracto urinario, realizada por un operador más capacitado, para ver si hay cálculos, tumores o sitios de obstrucción dentro de la vejiga y el tracto urinario.

También se puede ordenar una tomografía computarizada.
Se puede insertar una cámara interna flexible, llamada cistoscopio, para ver la apariencia interna de la vejiga y tomar una biopsia si es necesario.
Las pruebas urodinámicas pueden ayudar a explicar los síntomas.


== Otros animales ==


=== Mamíferos ===

Todos los mamíferos tienen una vejiga urinaria.

Esta estructura comienza como una cloaca embrionaria.

En la gran mayoría, este eventualmente se diferencia en una parte dorsal conectada con el intestino y una parte ventral que se asocia con el conducto urinogenital y la vejiga urinaria.

Los únicos mamíferos en los que esto no ocurre son el ornitorrinco y el oso hormiguero espinoso, los cuales conservan la cloaca hasta la edad adulta. La vejiga de los mamíferos es un órgano que almacena regularmente una concentración hiperosmótica de orina.

Por lo tanto, es relativamente impermeable y tiene múltiples capas epiteliales.

La vejiga urinaria de los cetáceos (ballenas y delfines) es proporcionalmente más pequeña que la de los mamíferos terrestres.


=== Reptiles ===

En todos los reptiles, los conductos urinogenitales y el ano desembocan en un órgano llamado cloaca.

En algunos reptiles, una pared medioventral de la cloaca puede desembocar en una vejiga urinaria, pero no en todos.

Está presente en todas las tortugas terrestres y terrestres, así como en la mayoría de los lagartos, pero falta en el lagarto monitor, los lagartos sin patas.

Está ausente en las serpientes, caimanes y cocodrilos.: pág. 474 Muchas tortugas, tortugas terrestres y lagartijas tienen vejigas proporcionalmente muy grandes.

Charles Darwin notó que la tortuga de Galápagos tenía una vejiga que podía almacenar hasta el 20% de su peso corporal.

Tales adaptaciones son el resultado de ambientes como islas remotas y desiertos donde el agua es muy escasa.

Otros reptiles que habitan en el desierto tienen vejigas grandes que pueden almacenar una reserva de agua a largo plazo durante varios meses y ayudar en la osmorregulación.

Las tortugas tienen dos o más vejigas urinarias accesorias, ubicadas lateralmente al cuello de la vejiga urinaria y dorsal al pubis, ocupando una porción significativa de su cavidad corporal. 

Su vejiga también suele ser bilobulada con una sección izquierda y otra derecha. 

La sección derecha se encuentra debajo del hígado, lo que evita que queden cálculos grandes en ese lado, mientras que la sección izquierda tiene más probabilidades de tener cálculos.


=== Anfibios ===

La mayoría de los anfibios acuáticos y semiacuáticos tienen una piel membranosa que les permite absorber agua directamente a través de ella. 

Algunos animales semiacuáticos también tienen una membrana vesical igualmente permeable. 

Como resultado, tienden a tener altas tasas de producción de orina para compensar esta alta ingesta de agua y tienen una orina baja en sales disueltas. 

La vejiga urinaria ayuda a estos animales a retener sales. 

Algunos anfibios acuáticos como Xenopus no reabsorben agua para evitar una entrada excesiva de agua. 

Para los anfibios terrestres, la deshidratación reduce la producción de orina. La vejiga de los anfibios suele ser muy distensible y, entre algunas especies terrestres de ranas y salamandras, puede representar entre el 20% y el 50% de su peso corporal total.


=== Pescado ===

Las branquias de la mayoría de los peces teleósteos ayudan a eliminar el amoníaco del cuerpo, y los peces viven rodeados de agua, pero la mayoría todavía tiene una vejiga distinta para almacenar los desechos. 

La vejiga urinaria de los teleósteos es permeable al agua, aunque esto es menos cierto para las especies que habitan en agua dulce que para las especies de agua salada.

La mayoría de los peces también tienen un órgano llamado vejiga natatoria que no está relacionado con la vejiga urinaria excepto en su naturaleza membranosa. 

Las lochas, las sardinas y los arenques se encuentran entre los pocos tipos de pescado en los que la vejiga urinaria está poco desarrollada.

Es más grande en los peces que carecen de vejiga aérea y está situado delante de los oviductos y detrás del recto.


=== Aves ===


En casi todas las especies de aves, no hay vejiga urinaria propiamente dicha.

Aunque todas las aves tienen riñones, los uréteres desembocan directamente en una cloaca que sirve como depósito de orina, materia fecal y huevos.


=== Crustáceos ===

A diferencia de la vejiga urinaria de los vertebrados, la vejiga urinaria de los crustáceos almacena y modifica la orina.

La vejiga consta de dos juegos de lóbulos lateral y central.

Los lóbulos centrales se asientan cerca de los órganos digestivos y los lóbulos laterales se extienden a lo largo del frente y los lados de la cavidad corporal del crustáceo.

El tejido de la vejiga es un epitelio delgado.

VESSIE URINAIRE


La vessie urinaire, ou simplement la vessie, est un organe musculaire creux chez l'homme et d'autres vertébrés qui stocke l'urine des reins avant son élimination par la miction.

Chez l'homme, la vessie est un organe creux extensible qui repose sur le plancher pelvien.

L'urine entre dans la vessie par les uretères et sort par l'urètre.

La vessie humaine typique contiendra entre 300 et 500 ml avant que l'envie de se vider ne se produise, mais peut en contenir beaucoup plus.

L'expression latine pour "vessie urinaire" est vesica urinaria, et le terme vesical ou préfixe vesico - apparaît en relation avec des structures associées telles que les veines vésicales.

Le mot latin moderne pour "vessie" - cystis - apparaît dans des termes associés tels que cystite (inflammation de la vessie).


== Structure ==


Chez l'homme, la vessie est un organe musculaire creux situé à la base du bassin.

Dans l'anatomie générale, la vessie peut être divisée en un large fond d'œil, un corps, un sommet et un cou.

L'apex est dirigé vers l'avant vers la partie supérieure de la symphyse pubienne, et à partir de là, le ligament ombilical médian continue vers le haut à l'arrière de la paroi abdominale antérieure jusqu'à l'ombilic.

Le péritoine est transporté par celui-ci de l'apex à la paroi abdominale pour former le pli ombilical moyen.

Le col de la vessie est la zone à la base du trigone qui entoure l'orifice urétral interne qui mène à l'urètre.

Chez les hommes, le col de la vessie est à côté de la prostate.
La vessie a trois ouvertures.

Les deux uretères pénètrent dans la vessie par des orifices urétéraux et l'urètre pénètre par le trigone de la vessie.

Ces ouvertures urétérales ont des volets muqueux devant eux qui agissent comme des valves pour empêcher le reflux d'urine dans les uretères, connu sous le nom de reflux vésico-urétéral.

Entre les deux ouvertures urétérales se trouve une zone de tissu surélevée appelée crête interurétérale.

Cela fait la limite supérieure du trigone.

Le trigone est une zone de muscle lisse qui forme le plancher de la vessie au-dessus de l'urètre.

C'est une zone de tissu lisse pour l'écoulement facile de l'urine dans et depuis cette partie de la vessie - contrairement à la surface irrégulière formée par les rugae.

Les parois de la vessie présentent une série de crêtes, d'épais plis muqueux appelés rugae qui permettent l'expansion de la vessie. 

Le muscle détrusor est la couche musculaire de la paroi constituée de fibres musculaires lisses disposées en faisceaux spiralés, longitudinaux et circulaires. 

Le muscle détrusor est capable de changer sa longueur. 

Il peut également se contracter pendant une longue période lors de la miction et il reste détendu pendant que la vessie se remplit. 

La paroi de la vessie a normalement une épaisseur de 3 à 5 mm. 

Lorsqu'elle est bien distendue, la paroi mesure normalement moins de 3 mm.


=== Structures à proximité ===


Chez l'homme, la prostate se situe à l'extérieur de l'ouverture de l'urètre. 

Le lobe moyen de la prostate provoque une élévation de la membrane muqueuse derrière l'orifice urétral interne appelé la luette de la vessie.

La luette peut grossir lorsque la prostate grossit.
La vessie est située sous la cavité péritonéale près du plancher pelvien et derrière la symphyse pubienne.

Chez l'homme, il se situe devant le rectum, séparé par la poche recto-vésicale, et est soutenu par les fibres du releveur de l'anus et de la prostate.

Chez la femme, il se situe devant l'utérus, séparé par la poche vésico-utérine, et est soutenu par l'élévateur anal et la partie supérieure du vagin.


=== Apport sanguin et lymphatique ===

La vessie reçoit le sang par les artères vésicales et drainé dans un réseau de veines vésicales.

L'artère vésicale supérieure irrigue la partie supérieure de la vessie.

La partie inférieure de la vessie est alimentée par l'artère vésicale inférieure, qui sont toutes deux des branches des artères iliaques internes.

Chez les femmes, les artères utérines et vaginales fournissent un apport sanguin supplémentaire.

Le drainage veineux commence dans un réseau de petits vaisseaux sur les surfaces latérales inférieures de la vessie, qui fusionnent et se déplacent avec les ligaments latéraux de la vessie dans les veines iliaques internes.

La lymphe drainée de la vessie commence dans une série de réseaux à travers les couches muqueuses, musculaires et séreuses.

Ceux-ci forment alors trois ensembles de vaisseaux : un ensemble près du trigone drainant le fond de la vessie ; un ensemble drainant le haut de la vessie ; et un autre ensemble drainant la surface inférieure externe de la vessie.

La majorité de ces vaisseaux se drainent dans les ganglions lymphatiques iliaques externes.


=== Innervation ===

La vessie reçoit à la fois l'alimentation sensorielle et motrice des systèmes nerveux sympathique et parasympathique. 

L'alimentation motrice des deux fibres sympathiques, dont la plupart proviennent des plexus et des nerfs hypogastriques supérieurs et inférieurs, et des fibres parasympathiques, qui proviennent des nerfs splanchniques pelviens. Sensation de la vessie, liée à une distension ou à une irritation (comme par infection ou un calcul) se transmet principalement par le système nerveux parasympathique. 

Ceux-ci voyagent via les nerfs sacrés vers S2-4. 

De là, la sensation se déplace vers le cerveau via les colonnes dorsales de la moelle épinière.


=== Microanatomie ===

Lorsqu'elle est vue au microscope, la vessie peut être vue comme ayant une paroi interne (appelée épithélium), trois couches de fibres musculaires et une adventice externe.

La paroi interne de la vessie est appelée urothélium, un type d'épithélium de transition formé de trois à six couches de cellules ; les cellules peuvent devenir plus cubiques ou plus plates selon que la vessie est vide ou pleine.

De plus, ceux-ci sont tapissés d'une membrane muqueuse constituée d'un glycocalyx de surface qui protège les cellules en dessous de l'urine.

L'épithélium repose sur une fine membrane basale et une lamina propria.

La muqueuse offre également une barrière urothéliale contre le passage des infections.

Ces couches sont entourées de trois couches de fibres musculaires disposées en une couche interne de fibres orientées longitudinalement, une couche médiane de fibres circulaires et une couche la plus externe de fibres longitudinales ; ceux-ci forment le muscle détrusor, visible à l'œil nu. L'extérieur de la vessie est protégé par une membrane séreuse appelée adventice.



=== Développement ===


Dans l'embryon en développement, à l'arrière se trouve un cloaque.

Celui-ci, au cours de la quatrième à la septième semaine, se divise en un sinus urogénital et les débuts du canal anal, avec une paroi se formant entre ces deux inpouchings appelée septum urorectal.

Le sinus urogénital se divise en trois parties, la partie supérieure et la plus grande devenant la vessie ; la partie médiane devient l'urètre, et la partie inférieure change en fonction du sexe biologique de l'embryon. La vessie humaine dérive du sinus urogénital, et elle est initialement en continuité avec l'allantoïde.

Les parties supérieure et inférieure de la vessie se développent séparément et se rejoignent autour de la partie médiane du développement.

À ce moment, les uretères se déplacent des canaux mésonéphriques vers le trigone.

Chez les hommes, la base de la vessie se situe entre le rectum et la symphyse pubienne.

Elle est supérieure à la prostate et séparée du rectum par la poche recto-vésicale.

Chez les femelles, la vessie se trouve en dessous de l'utérus et en avant du vagin; ainsi sa capacité maximale est inférieure à celle des mâles.

Il est séparé de l'utérus par la poche vésico-utérine.

Chez les nourrissons et les jeunes enfants, la vessie urinaire est dans l'abdomen même lorsqu'elle est vide.


== Fonction ==


L'urine, excrétée par les reins, s'accumule dans la vessie en raison du drainage de deux uretères, avant d'être éliminée par la miction (miction).

L'urine quitte la vessie par l'urètre, un seul tube musculaire se terminant par une ouverture appelée méat urinaire, où elle sort du corps.

La miction implique des changements musculaires coordonnés impliquant un réflexe basé dans la colonne vertébrale, avec des apports plus élevés du cerveau.

Pendant la miction, le muscle du détrusor se contracte et le sphincter urinaire externe et les muscles du périnée se détendent, permettant à l'urine de traverser l'urètre et de sortir du corps.

L'envie d'uriner provient des récepteurs d'étirement qui s'activent lorsqu'entre 300 et 400 ml d'urine sont retenus dans la vessie. 

Au fur et à mesure que l'urine s'accumule, les rugae s'aplatissent et la paroi de la vessie s'amincit à mesure qu'elle s'étire, permettant à la vessie de stocker de plus grandes quantités d'urine sans augmentation significative de la pression interne. 

La miction est contrôlée par le centre pontique de la miction dans le tronc cérébral. Les récepteurs d'étirement dans la vessie signalent au système nerveux parasympathique de stimuler les récepteurs muscariniques du détrusor pour contracter le muscle lorsque la vessie est distendue. 

Cela encourage la vessie à expulser l'urine par l'urètre. 

Le principal récepteur activé est le récepteur M3, bien que les récepteurs M2 soient également impliqués et bien qu'ils soient plus nombreux que les récepteurs M3, ils ne sont pas aussi réactifs.

La principale voie relaxante est la voie de l'adénylyl cyclase cAMP, activée via les récepteurs β3 adrénergiques.

Les récepteurs β2 adrénergiques sont également présents dans le détrusor et sont même plus nombreux que les récepteurs β3, mais ils n'ont pas un effet aussi important sur la relaxation du muscle lisse du détrusor.


== Signification clinique ==


=== Inflammation et infection ===


La cystite désigne une infection ou une inflammation de la vessie.

Il survient généralement dans le cadre d'une infection des voies urinaires.

Chez les adultes, il est plus fréquent chez les femmes que chez les hommes, en raison d'un urètre plus court.

Il est fréquent chez les hommes pendant l'enfance et chez les hommes plus âgés où une hypertrophie de la prostate peut provoquer une rétention urinaire.

D'autres facteurs de risque comprennent d'autres causes de blocage ou de rétrécissement, comme le cancer de la prostate ou la présence de reflux vésico-urétéral ; la présence de structures extérieures dans les voies urinaires, telles que des cathéters urinaires ; et des problèmes neurologiques qui rendent le passage de l'urine difficile.

Les infections impliquant la vessie peuvent provoquer des douleurs dans le bas-ventre (au-dessus de la symphyse pubienne, dites douleurs "suprapubiennes"), en particulier avant et après avoir uriné, et un désir d'uriner fréquemment et sans avertissement (urgence urinaire).

Les infections sont généralement dues à des bactéries, dont la plus courante est E coli. Lorsqu'une infection des voies urinaires ou une cystite est suspectée, un médecin peut demander un échantillon d'urine.

Une jauge placée dans l'urine peut être utilisée pour voir si l'urine contient des globules blancs ou la présence de nitrates qui peuvent indiquer une infection.

L'échantillon d'urine peut également être envoyé pour culture microbienne et sensibilité afin d'évaluer si une bactérie particulière se développe dans l'urine et d'identifier ses sensibilités aux antibiotiques.

Parfois, des investigations complémentaires peuvent être demandées.

Celles-ci pourraient inclure des tests de la fonction des reins en évaluant les électrolytes et la créatinine ; rechercher des blocages ou un rétrécissement du tractus rénal avec une échographie et rechercher une hypertrophie de la prostate avec un toucher rectal.

Les infections des voies urinaires ou la cystite sont traitées avec des antibiotiques, dont beaucoup sont consommés par voie orale.

Les infections graves peuvent nécessiter un traitement avec des antibiotiques intraveineux. La cystite interstitielle fait référence à une affection dans laquelle la vessie est infectée en raison d'une cause qui n'est pas une bactérie.


=== Incontinence et rétention ===

La miction fréquente peut être due à une production excessive d'urine, à une faible capacité de la vessie, à l'irritabilité ou à une vidange incomplète. 

Les hommes avec une hypertrophie de la prostate urinent plus fréquemment. 

Une définition d'une vessie hyperactive est lorsqu'une personne urine plus de huit fois par jour. 

Une vessie hyperactive peut souvent provoquer une incontinence urinaire. 

Bien qu'il ait été démontré que la fréquence et les volumes urinaires ont un rythme circadien, c'est-à-dire des cycles diurnes et nocturnes, il n'est pas tout à fait clair comment ceux-ci sont perturbés dans la vessie hyperactive. 

Les tests urodynamiques peuvent aider à expliquer les symptômes. 

Une vessie sous-active est la condition où il y a une difficulté à uriner et est le principal symptôme d'une vessie neurogène.

Des mictions fréquentes la nuit peuvent indiquer la présence de calculs vésicaux.
Les troubles de la vessie ou liés à celle-ci comprennent :

Exstrophie vésicale
Dyssynergie du sphincter de la vessie, une condition dans laquelle la victime ne peut pas coordonner la relaxation du sphincter de l'urètre avec la contraction des muscles de la vessie
Parurésie
Trigonite
Rétention urinaire

Les troubles de la fonction vésicale peuvent être traités chirurgicalement, en redirigeant le flux d'urine ou en le remplaçant par une vessie artificielle.

Le volume de la vessie peut être augmenté par une augmentation de la vessie.

Une obstruction du col de la vessie peut être suffisamment grave pour justifier une intervention chirurgicale.


=== Cancer ===


Le cancer de la vessie est connu sous le nom de cancer de la vessie.

Elle est généralement due au cancer de l'urothélium, les cellules qui tapissent la surface de la vessie. 

Le cancer de la vessie est plus fréquent après l'âge de 40 ans et plus fréquent chez les hommes que chez les femmes. d'autres facteurs de risque comprennent le tabagisme et l'exposition à des colorants tels que les amines aromatiques et les aldéhydes.

Lorsqu'un cancer est présent, le symptôme le plus courant chez une personne affectée est la présence de sang dans l'urine; un examen médical physique peut être par ailleurs normal, sauf en cas de maladie tardive.

Le cancer de la vessie est le plus souvent dû au cancer des cellules qui tapissent l'uretère, appelé carcinome à cellules transitionnelles, bien qu'il puisse plus rarement se présenter sous la forme d'un carcinome épidermoïde si le type de cellules qui tapissent l'urètre a changé en raison d'une inflammation chronique, par exemple en raison de calculs ou schistosomiase.

Les investigations effectuées comprennent généralement la collecte d'un échantillon d'urine pour une inspection des cellules malignes au microscope, appelée cytologie, ainsi qu'une imagerie médicale par un urogramme CT ou une échographie.

Si une lésion préoccupante est observée, une caméra flexible peut être insérée dans la vessie, appelée cystoscopie, afin de visualiser la lésion et de faire une biopsie, et un scanner sera effectué sur d'autres parties du corps (un scanner du thorax, abdomen et bassin) pour rechercher d'autres lésions métastatiques. Le traitement dépend du stade du cancer.

Le cancer présent uniquement dans la vessie peut être enlevé chirurgicalement par cystoscopie; une injection de mitomycine C chimiothérapeutique peut être effectuée en même temps.

Les cancers de haut grade peuvent être traités par une injection du vaccin BCG dans la paroi de la vessie et peuvent nécessiter une ablation chirurgicale s'ils ne disparaissent pas.

Le cancer qui envahit la paroi de la vessie peut être pris en charge par l'ablation chirurgicale complète de la vessie (cystectomie radicale), les uretères étant détournés dans un segment d'une partie de l'iléon relié à un sac de stomie sur la peau.

Le pronostic peut varier considérablement en fonction du stade et du grade du cancer, avec un meilleur pronostic associé aux tumeurs présentes uniquement dans la vessie, de bas grade, qui n'envahissent pas la paroi de la vessie et qui ont un aspect visuel papillaire.


=== Enquête ===


Un certain nombre d'investigations sont utilisées pour examiner la vessie.

Les investigations qui seront ordonnées dépendront de la prise d'antécédents médicaux et d'un examen.

L'examen peut impliquer qu'un médecin ressente dans la région sus-pubienne une sensibilité ou une plénitude pouvant indiquer une vessie enflammée ou pleine.

Des tests sanguins peuvent être commandés qui peuvent indiquer une inflammation; par exemple, une numération globulaire complète peut montrer des globules blancs élevés, ou une protéine C-réactive peut être élevée dans une infection. Certaines formes d'imagerie médicale existent pour visualiser la vessie.

Une échographie de la vessie peut être effectuée pour voir la quantité d'urine dans la vessie, indiquant une rétention urinaire.

Une échographie des voies urinaires, effectuée par un opérateur plus qualifié, peut être effectuée pour voir s'il y a des calculs, des tumeurs ou des sites d'obstruction dans la vessie et les voies urinaires.

Un scanner peut également être commandé.
Une caméra interne flexible, appelée cystoscope, peut être insérée pour visualiser l'aspect interne de la vessie et effectuer une biopsie si nécessaire.
Les tests urodynamiques peuvent aider à expliquer les symptômes.


== Autres animaux ==


=== Mammifères ===

Tous les mammifères ont une vessie urinaire.

Cette structure commence comme un cloaque embryonnaire. 

Dans la grande majorité, cela finit par se différencier en une partie dorsale reliée à l'intestin et une partie ventrale qui s'associe au passage urogénital et à la vessie. 

Les seuls mammifères chez lesquels cela ne se produit pas sont l'ornithorynque et le fourmilier épineux qui conservent tous deux le cloaque à l'âge adulte. La vessie de mammifère est un organe qui stocke régulièrement une concentration hyperosmotique d'urine. 

Il est donc relativement imperméable et possède de multiples couches épithéliales. 

La vessie des cétacés (baleines et dauphins) est proportionnellement plus petite que celle des mammifères terrestres.


=== Reptiles ===

Chez tous les reptiles, les canaux génito-urinaires et l'anus se vident tous deux dans un organe appelé cloaque. 

Chez certains reptiles, une paroi ventrale médiane du cloaque peut s'ouvrir dans une vessie urinaire, mais pas tous. 

Il est présent chez toutes les tortues terrestres et terrestres ainsi que chez la plupart des lézards mais fait défaut chez le varan, les lézards sans pattes. 

Il est absent chez les serpents, les alligators et les crocodiles. : p. 474 De nombreuses tortues, tortues terrestres et lézards ont des vessies proportionnellement très grandes.

Charles Darwin a noté que la tortue des Galapagos avait une vessie qui pouvait stocker jusqu'à 20% de son poids corporel. 

Ces adaptations sont le résultat d'environnements tels que les îles éloignées et les déserts où l'eau est très rare. 

D'autres reptiles vivant dans le désert ont de grandes vessies qui peuvent stocker un réservoir d'eau à long terme jusqu'à plusieurs mois et aider à l'osmorégulation.

Les tortues ont deux ou plusieurs vessies urinaires accessoires, situées latéralement au col de la vessie et dorsales au pubis, occupant une partie importante de leur cavité corporelle. 

Leur vessie est également généralement bilobée avec une section gauche et droite. 

La section droite est située sous le foie, ce qui empêche les grosses pierres de rester de ce côté tandis que la section gauche est plus susceptible d'avoir des calculs.


=== Amphibiens ===

La plupart des amphibiens aquatiques et semi-aquatiques ont une peau membraneuse qui leur permet d'absorber l'eau directement à travers celle-ci. 

Certains animaux semi-aquatiques ont également une membrane vésicale perméable de la même manière. 

En conséquence, ils ont tendance à avoir des taux élevés de production d'urine pour compenser cette forte consommation d'eau et ont une urine pauvre en sels dissous. 

La vessie aide ces animaux à retenir les sels. 

Certains amphibiens aquatiques tels que Xenopus ne réabsorbent pas l'eau, pour éviter un apport d'eau excessif. 

Pour les amphibiens terrestres, la déshydratation entraîne une réduction de la production d'urine. La vessie des amphibiens est généralement très distensible et, chez certaines espèces terrestres de grenouilles et de salamandres, elle peut représenter entre 20 % et 50 % de leur poids corporel total.


=== Poisson ===

Les branchies de la plupart des poissons téléostéens aident à éliminer l'ammoniac du corps, et les poissons vivent entourés d'eau, mais la plupart ont encore une vessie distincte pour stocker les déchets liquides. 

La vessie urinaire des téléostéens est perméable à l'eau, bien que cela soit moins vrai pour les espèces d'eau douce que pour les espèces d'eau salée.

La plupart des poissons ont également un organe appelé vessie natatoire qui n'a aucun rapport avec la vessie urinaire, sauf dans sa nature membraneuse. 

Les loches, les sardines et les harengs font partie des rares types de poissons chez lesquels la vessie urinaire est peu développée. 

Il est le plus grand chez les poissons qui n'ont pas de vessie à air et est situé devant les oviductes et derrière le rectum.


=== Oiseaux ===


Chez presque toutes les espèces d'oiseaux, il n'y a pas de vessie en soi. 

Bien que tous les oiseaux aient des reins, les uretères s'ouvrent directement dans un cloaque qui sert de réservoir pour l'urine, les matières fécales et les œufs.


=== Crustacés ===

Contrairement à la vessie des vertébrés, la vessie des crustacés stocke et modifie à la fois l'urine. 

La vessie se compose de deux ensembles de lobes latéraux et centraux. 

Les lobes centraux se trouvent près des organes digestifs et les lobes latéraux s'étendent le long de l'avant et des côtés de la cavité corporelle du crustacé. 

Le tissu de la vessie est un épithélium mince.

BEXIGA URINÁRIA


A bexiga urinária, ou simplesmente bexiga, é um órgão muscular oco em humanos e outros vertebrados que armazena a urina dos rins antes de ser eliminada pela micção. 

Nos humanos, a bexiga é um órgão distensível oco que fica no assoalho pélvico. 

A urina entra na bexiga pelos ureteres e sai pela uretra. 

A bexiga humana típica conterá entre 300 e 500 ml antes que o desejo de esvaziar ocorra, mas pode conter consideravelmente mais.

A frase latina para "bexiga urinária" é vesica urinaria, e o termo vesical ou prefixo vesico - aparece em conexão com estruturas associadas, como veias vesicais.

A palavra latina moderna para "bexiga" - cystis - aparece em termos associados, como cistite (inflamação da bexiga).


== Estrutura ==


Nos humanos, a bexiga é um órgão muscular oco situado na base da pelve.

Na anatomia macroscópica, a bexiga pode ser dividida em fundo amplo, corpo, ápice e colo.

O ápice é direcionado para a parte superior da sínfise púbica e, a partir daí, o ligamento umbilical mediano continua para cima na parte posterior da parede abdominal anterior até o umbigo.

O peritônio é transportado por ele do ápice até a parede abdominal para formar a prega umbilical média. 

O colo da bexiga é a área na base do trígono que circunda o orifício uretral interno que leva à uretra. 

Nos homens, o colo da bexiga está próximo à próstata.
A bexiga tem três aberturas. 

Os dois ureteres entram na bexiga pelos orifícios ureterais, e a uretra entra no trígono da bexiga. 

Essas aberturas ureterais têm retalhos de mucosa na frente deles que atuam como válvulas na prevenção do refluxo de urina para os ureteres, conhecido como refluxo vesicoureteral. 

Entre as duas aberturas ureterais há uma área elevada de tecido chamada crista interureteral. 

Isso faz o limite superior do trígono. 

O trígono é uma área de músculo liso que forma o assoalho da bexiga acima da uretra. 

É uma área de tecido liso para o fluxo fácil de urina para dentro e para fora desta parte da bexiga - em contraste com a superfície irregular formada pelas rugas.

As paredes da bexiga têm uma série de cristas, pregas mucosas espessas conhecidas como rugas que permitem a expansão da bexiga. 

O músculo detrusor é a camada muscular da parede composta de fibras musculares lisas dispostas em feixes espirais, longitudinais e circulares. 

O músculo detrusor é capaz de alterar seu comprimento. 

Ele também pode se contrair por um longo tempo durante a micção e permanece relaxado enquanto a bexiga está enchendo. 

A parede da bexiga urinária normalmente tem 3 a 5 mm de espessura. 

Quando bem distendida, a parede normalmente tem menos de 3 mm.


=== Estruturas próximas ===


Nos homens, a próstata fica fora da abertura da uretra. 

O lobo médio da próstata causa uma elevação na membrana mucosa atrás do orifício uretral interno chamado úvula da bexiga urinária.

A úvula pode aumentar quando a próstata aumenta.
A bexiga está localizada abaixo da cavidade peritoneal, próximo ao assoalho pélvico e atrás da sínfise púbica.

Nos homens, situa-se na frente do reto, separado pela bolsa reto-vesical, e é sustentado por fibras do elevador do ânus e da próstata.

Nas mulheres, situa-se na frente do útero, separado pela bolsa vesico-uterina, e é sustentado pelo elevador do ânus e pela parte superior da vagina.


=== Suprimento de sangue e linfa ===

A bexiga recebe sangue pelas artérias vesicais e drena para uma rede de veias vesicais.

A artéria vesical superior fornece sangue para a parte superior da bexiga.

A parte inferior da bexiga é suprida pela artéria vesical inferior, ambas ramos das artérias ilíacas internas.

Nas mulheres, as artérias uterinas e vaginais fornecem suprimento sanguíneo adicional.

A drenagem venosa começa em uma rede de pequenos vasos nas superfícies laterais inferiores da bexiga, que coalescem e viajam com os ligamentos laterais da bexiga nas veias ilíacas internas.

A linfa drenada da bexiga começa em uma série de redes ao longo das camadas mucosa, muscular e serosa.

Estes então formam três conjuntos de vasos: um próximo ao trígono que drena o fundo da bexiga; um conjunto drenando a parte superior da bexiga; e outro conjunto drenando a superfície inferior externa da bexiga.

A maioria desses vasos drena para os linfonodos ilíacos externos.


=== Suprimento nervoso ===

A bexiga recebe suprimento sensorial e motor dos sistemas nervosos simpático e parassimpático.

O suprimento motor de ambas as fibras simpáticas, a maioria das quais se origina dos plexos e nervos hipogástricos superior e inferior, e das fibras parassimpáticas, que vêm dos nervos esplâncnicos pélvicos. infecção ou um cálculo) é transmitido principalmente através do sistema nervoso parassimpático.

Estes viajam através dos nervos sacrais para S2-4.

A partir daqui, a sensação viaja para o cérebro através das colunas dorsais na medula espinhal.


=== Microanatomia ===

Quando vista ao microscópio, a bexiga pode ser vista como tendo um revestimento interno (chamado epitélio), três camadas de fibras musculares e uma adventícia externa.

A parede interna da bexiga é chamada de urotélio, um tipo de epitélio de transição formado por três a seis camadas de células; as células podem tornar-se mais cúbicas ou mais planas, dependendo se a bexiga está vazia ou cheia.

Além disso, estes são revestidos com uma membrana mucosa que consiste em um glicocálice de superfície que protege as células abaixo dele da urina.

O epitélio encontra-se sobre uma fina membrana basal e uma lâmina própria.

O revestimento da mucosa também oferece uma barreira urotelial contra a passagem de infecções.

Essas camadas são circundadas por três camadas de fibras musculares dispostas como uma camada interna de fibras orientadas longitudinalmente, uma camada intermediária de fibras circulares e uma camada externa de fibras longitudinais; estes formam o músculo detrusor, que pode ser visto a olho nu. A parte externa da bexiga é protegida por uma membrana serosa chamada adventícia.



=== Desenvolvimento ===


No embrião em desenvolvimento, na extremidade posterior encontra-se uma cloaca.

Este, ao longo da quarta à sétima semana, divide-se em um seio urogenital e no início do canal anal, com uma parede se formando entre essas duas bolsas denominada septo urorretal.

O seio urogenital se divide em três partes, com a parte superior e maior tornando-se a bexiga; a parte média torna-se a uretra, e a parte inferior muda dependendo do sexo biológico do embrião. A bexiga urinária humana deriva do seio urogenital e é inicialmente contínua com o alantoide.

As partes superior e inferior da bexiga desenvolvem-se separadamente e juntam-se em torno da parte média do desenvolvimento. 

Nesse momento, os ureteres se movem dos ductos mesonéfricos para o trígono. 

Nos homens, a base da bexiga situa-se entre o reto e a sínfise púbica. 

É superior à próstata e separada do reto pela bolsa reto-vesical. 

Nas mulheres, a bexiga fica inferior ao útero e anterior à vagina; assim, sua capacidade máxima é menor do que nos machos.

É separado do útero pela bolsa vesico-uterina. 

Em bebês e crianças pequenas, a bexiga urinária está no abdômen mesmo quando vazia.


== Função ==


A urina, excretada pelos rins, é coletada na bexiga devido à drenagem de dois ureteres, antes de ser eliminada pela micção (micção). 

A urina sai da bexiga pela uretra, um único tubo muscular que termina em uma abertura chamada meato urinário, de onde sai do corpo. 

A micção envolve mudanças musculares coordenadas envolvendo um reflexo baseado na coluna, com entradas mais altas do cérebro. 

Durante a micção, o músculo detrusor se contrai e o esfíncter urinário externo e os músculos do períneo relaxam, permitindo que a urina passe pela uretra e saia do corpo.

O desejo de urinar decorre de receptores de estiramento que são ativados quando entre 300 e 400 mL de urina são mantidos dentro da bexiga. 

À medida que a urina se acumula, as rugas se achatam e a parede da bexiga se afina à medida que se estica, permitindo que a bexiga armazene maiores quantidades de urina sem um aumento significativo na pressão interna. 

A micção é controlada pelo centro pontino da micção no tronco cerebral. Os receptores de estiramento na bexiga sinalizam ao sistema nervoso parassimpático para estimular os receptores muscarínicos no detrusor a contrair o músculo quando a bexiga é distendida. 

Isso estimula a bexiga a expelir a urina pela uretra. 

O principal receptor ativado é o receptor M3, embora os receptores M2 também estejam envolvidos e, embora superem os receptores M3, eles não são tão responsivos.

A principal via relaxante é a via da adenilil ciclase cAMP, ativada pelos receptores β3 adrenérgicos.

Os receptores β2 adrenérgicos também estão presentes no detrusor e até superam os receptores β3, mas não têm um efeito tão importante no relaxamento da musculatura lisa do detrusor.


== Significado clínico ==


=== Inflamação e infecção ===


Cistite refere-se a infecção ou inflamação da bexiga.

Geralmente ocorre como parte de uma infecção do trato urinário.

Em adultos, é mais comum em mulheres do que em homens, devido a uma uretra mais curta.

É comum em homens durante a infância e em homens mais velhos, onde o aumento da próstata pode causar retenção urinária.

Outros fatores de risco incluem outras causas de bloqueio ou estreitamento, como câncer de próstata ou a presença de refluxo vesico-ureteral; a presença de estruturas externas no trato urinário, como cateteres urinários; e problemas neurológicos que dificultam a passagem da urina.

As infecções que envolvem a bexiga podem causar dor na parte inferior do abdome (acima da sínfise púbica, a chamada dor "suprapúbica"), particularmente antes e depois de urinar e desejo de urinar com frequência e pouco aviso (urgência urinária).

As infecções são geralmente causadas por bactérias, das quais a mais comum é a E coli. Quando há suspeita de infecção do trato urinário ou cistite, um médico pode solicitar uma amostra de urina.

Uma vareta colocada na urina pode ser usada para ver se a urina tem glóbulos brancos ou a presença de nitratos que podem indicar uma infecção.

A amostra de urina também pode ser enviada para cultura microbiana e sensibilidade para avaliar se uma determinada bactéria cresce na urina e identificar suas sensibilidades aos antibióticos.

Às vezes, investigações adicionais podem ser solicitadas.

Estes podem incluir testar a função dos rins avaliando eletrólitos e creatinina; investigar bloqueios ou estreitamento do trato renal com um ultra-som e testar uma próstata aumentada com um exame de toque retal.

Infecções do trato urinário ou cistite são tratadas com antibióticos, muitos dos quais são consumidos por via oral.

Infecções graves podem exigir tratamento com antibióticos intravenosos. A cistite intersticial refere-se a uma condição na qual a bexiga está infectada devido a uma causa que não é bacteriana.


=== Incontinência e retenção ===

A micção frequente pode ser devido à produção excessiva de urina, pequena capacidade da bexiga, irritabilidade ou esvaziamento incompleto. 

Homens com próstata aumentada urinam com mais frequência. 

Uma definição de bexiga hiperativa é quando uma pessoa urina mais de oito vezes por dia. 

Uma bexiga hiperativa muitas vezes pode causar incontinência urinária. 

Embora a frequência e os volumes urinários tenham mostrado um ritmo circadiano, ou seja, ciclos diurnos e noturnos, não está totalmente claro como eles são perturbados na bexiga hiperativa. 

O teste urodinâmico pode ajudar a explicar os sintomas. 

Uma bexiga hipoativa é a condição em que há dificuldade em urinar e é o principal sintoma de uma bexiga neurogênica.

A micção frequente à noite pode indicar a presença de pedras na bexiga.
Distúrbios de ou relacionados com a bexiga incluem:

Extrofia da bexiga
Dissinergia do esfíncter da bexiga, uma condição na qual o paciente não consegue coordenar o relaxamento do esfíncter da uretra com a contração dos músculos da bexiga
Paruresis
Trigonite
Retenção urinária

Distúrbios da função da bexiga podem ser tratados cirurgicamente, redirecionando o fluxo de urina ou pela substituição por uma bexiga urinária artificial.

O volume da bexiga pode ser aumentado pelo aumento da bexiga.

Uma obstrução do colo da bexiga pode ser grave o suficiente para justificar a cirurgia.


=== Câncer ===


O câncer de bexiga é conhecido como câncer de bexiga.

Geralmente é devido ao câncer do urotélio, as células que revestem a superfície da bexiga.

O câncer de bexiga é mais comum após os 40 anos e mais comum em homens do que em mulheres; outros fatores de risco incluem tabagismo e exposição a corantes como aminas aromáticas e aldeídos.

Quando o câncer está presente, o sintoma mais comum em uma pessoa afetada é sangue na urina; um exame médico físico pode ser normal, exceto na doença tardia.

O câncer de bexiga é mais frequentemente devido ao câncer das células que revestem o ureter, chamado carcinoma de células transicionais, embora possa ocorrer mais raramente como carcinoma de células escamosas se o tipo de células que revestem a uretra mudou devido à inflamação crônica, como devido a cálculos ou esquistossomose.

As investigações realizadas geralmente incluem a coleta de uma amostra de urina para uma inspeção de células malignas ao microscópio, chamada citologia, bem como imagens médicas por urografia por tomografia computadorizada ou ultrassonografia. 

Se uma lesão preocupante for observada, uma câmera flexível pode ser inserida na bexiga, chamada cistoscopia, para visualizar a lesão e fazer uma biópsia, e uma tomografia computadorizada será realizada de outras partes do corpo (uma tomografia computadorizada do tórax, abdômen e pelve) para procurar lesões metastáticas adicionais. O tratamento depende do estágio do câncer. 

O câncer presente apenas na bexiga pode ser removido cirurgicamente por cistoscopia; uma injeção da mitomicina C quimioterapêutica pode ser realizada ao mesmo tempo.

Os cânceres de alto grau podem ser tratados com uma injeção da vacina BCG na parede da bexiga e podem exigir remoção cirúrgica se não resolverem. 

O câncer que invade a parede da bexiga pode ser controlado pela remoção cirúrgica completa da bexiga (cistectomia radical), com os ureteres desviados para um segmento de parte do íleo conectado a uma bolsa de estoma na pele. 

O prognóstico pode variar acentuadamente dependendo do estágio e grau do câncer, com melhor prognóstico associado a tumores encontrados apenas na bexiga, que são de baixo grau, que não invadem a parede da bexiga e que são papilares na aparência visual.


=== Investigação ===


Uma série de investigações são usadas para examinar a bexiga. 

As investigações que são solicitadas dependerão da obtenção de um histórico médico e de um exame. 

O exame pode envolver um médico sentindo na área suprapúbica para sensibilidade ou plenitude que pode indicar uma bexiga inflamada ou cheia. 

Podem ser solicitados exames de sangue que podem indicar inflamação; por exemplo, um hemograma completo pode demonstrar glóbulos brancos elevados, ou uma proteína C reativa pode estar elevada em uma infecção. Existem algumas formas de imagens médicas para visualizar a bexiga.

Um ultra-som da bexiga pode ser realizado para ver a quantidade de urina dentro da bexiga, indicando retenção urinária.

Uma ultrassonografia do trato urinário, realizada por um operador mais treinado, pode ser realizada para verificar se há cálculos, tumores ou locais de obstrução na bexiga e no trato urinário.

Uma tomografia computadorizada também pode ser solicitada.
Uma câmera interna flexível, chamada cistoscópio, pode ser inserida para visualizar a aparência interna da bexiga e fazer uma biópsia, se necessário.
O teste urodinâmico pode ajudar a explicar os sintomas.


== Outros animais ==


=== Mamíferos ===

Todos os mamíferos têm bexiga urinária.

Esta estrutura começa como uma cloaca embrionária. 

Na grande maioria, isso acaba se diferenciando em uma parte dorsal ligada ao intestino e uma parte ventral que passa a ser associada à passagem urogenital e bexiga urinária. 

Os únicos mamíferos em que isso não ocorre são o ornitorrinco e o tamanduá, ambos retêm a cloaca na idade adulta. A bexiga dos mamíferos é um órgão que armazena regularmente uma concentração hiperosmótica de urina. 

Portanto, é relativamente impermeável e possui múltiplas camadas epiteliais. 

A bexiga urinária dos cetáceos (baleias e golfinhos) é proporcionalmente menor que a dos mamíferos terrestres.


=== Répteis ===

Em todos os répteis, os ductos urinogenitais e o ânus desembocam em um órgão chamado cloaca. 

Em alguns répteis, uma parede ventral média na cloaca pode se abrir em uma bexiga urinária, mas não em todos.

Está presente em todas as tartarugas e cágados, bem como na maioria dos lagartos, mas está ausente no lagarto monitor, os lagartos sem pernas.

Está ausente nas cobras, jacarés e crocodilos.: p. 474 Muitas tartarugas, cágados e lagartos têm bexigas proporcionalmente muito grandes.

Charles Darwin observou que a tartaruga de Galápagos tinha uma bexiga que podia armazenar até 20% do seu peso corporal.

Tais adaptações são resultado de ambientes como ilhas remotas e desertos onde a água é muito escassa.

Outros répteis que vivem no deserto têm grandes bexigas que podem armazenar um reservatório de água a longo prazo por vários meses e ajudar na osmorregulação.

As tartarugas possuem duas ou mais bexigas urinárias acessórias, localizadas lateralmente ao colo da bexiga urinária e dorsal ao púbis, ocupando uma porção significativa de sua cavidade corporal.

Sua bexiga também é geralmente bilobada com uma seção esquerda e direita.

A seção direita está localizada sob o fígado, o que evita que grandes pedras permaneçam nesse lado, enquanto a seção esquerda é mais propensa a ter cálculos.


=== Anfíbios ===

A maioria dos anfíbios aquáticos e semi-aquáticos tem uma pele membranosa que lhes permite absorver água diretamente através dela.

Alguns animais semi-aquáticos também têm membrana vesical permeável semelhante.

Como resultado, eles tendem a ter altas taxas de produção de urina para compensar essa alta ingestão de água e têm urina com baixo teor de sais dissolvidos.

A bexiga urinária ajuda esses animais a reter sais.

Alguns anfíbios aquáticos, como o Xenopus, não reabsorvem água, para evitar o influxo excessivo de água.

Para anfíbios terrestres, a desidratação resulta em produção reduzida de urina. A bexiga dos anfíbios geralmente é altamente distensível e, entre algumas espécies terrestres de rãs e salamandras, pode representar entre 20% e 50% de seu peso corporal total.


=== Peixe ===

As brânquias da maioria dos peixes teleósteos ajudam a eliminar a amônia do corpo, e os peixes vivem cercados por água, mas a maioria ainda tem uma bexiga distinta para armazenar o fluido residual.

A bexiga urinária dos teleósteos é permeável à água, embora isso seja menos verdadeiro para espécies de água doce do que para espécies de água salgada.

A maioria dos peixes também possui um órgão chamado bexiga natatória, que não está relacionado à bexiga urinária, exceto em sua natureza membranosa.

As botias, sardinhas e arenques estão entre os poucos tipos de peixes em que a bexiga urinária é pouco desenvolvida. 

É maior naqueles peixes que não possuem bexiga de ar e situa-se na frente dos ovidutos e atrás do reto.


=== Aves ===


Em quase todas as espécies de aves, não há bexiga urinária per se. 

Embora todas as aves tenham rins, os ureteres se abrem diretamente em uma cloaca que serve como reservatório de urina, matéria fecal e ovos.


=== Crustáceos ===

Ao contrário da bexiga urinária dos vertebrados, a bexiga urinária dos crustáceos armazena e modifica a urina. 

A bexiga consiste em dois conjuntos de lobos laterais e centrais. 

Os lobos centrais ficam perto dos órgãos digestivos e os lobos laterais se estendem ao longo da frente e dos lados da cavidade do corpo do crustáceo. 

O tecido da bexiga é um epitélio fino.
