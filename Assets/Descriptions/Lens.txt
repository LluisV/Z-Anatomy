LENS


The lens is a transparent biconvex structure in the eye that, along with the cornea, helps to refract light to be focused on the retina. 

By changing shape, it functions to change the focal length of the eye so that it can focus on objects at various distances, thus allowing a sharp real image of the object of interest to be formed on the retina. 

This adjustment of the lens is known as accommodation (see also below). 

Accommodation is similar to the focusing of a photographic camera via movement of its lenses. 

The lens is flatter on its anterior side than on its posterior side.
The lens is also known as the aquula (Latin, a little stream, dim. of aqua, water) or crystalline lens. 

In humans, the refractive power of the lens in its natural environment is approximately 18 dioptres, roughly one-third of the eye's total power.


== Structure ==

The lens is part of the anterior segment of the human eye. 

In front of the lens is the iris, which regulates the amount of light entering into the eye. 

The lens is suspended in place by the suspensory ligament of the lens, a ring of fibrous tissue that attaches to the lens at its equator and connects it to the ciliary body. 

Posterior to the lens is the vitreous body, which, along with the aqueous humor on the anterior surface, bathes the lens. 

The lens has an ellipsoid, biconvex shape. 

The anterior surface is less curved than the posterior. 

In the adult, the lens is typically circa 10 mm in diameter and has an axial length of about 4 mm, though it is important to note that the size and shape can change due to accommodation and because the lens continues to grow throughout a person's lifetime.


=== Microanatomy ===

The lens has three main parts: the lens capsule, the lens epithelium, and the lens fibers. 

The lens capsule forms the outermost layer of the lens and the lens fibers form the bulk of the interior of the lens. 

The cells of the lens epithelium, located between the lens capsule and the outermost layer of lens fibers, are found only on the anterior side of the lens. 

The lens itself lacks nerves, blood vessels, or connective tissue.


==== Lens capsule ====
The lens capsule is a smooth, transparent basement membrane that completely surrounds the lens. 

The capsule is elastic and is composed of collagen. 

It is synthesized by the lens epithelium and its main components are type IV collagen and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). 

The capsule is very elastic and so allows the lens to assume a more spherical shape when not under the tension of the zonular fibers (also called suspensory ligaments), which connect the lens capsule to the ciliary body. 

The capsule varies from 2 to 28 micrometres in thickness, being thickest near the equator and thinnest near the posterior pole.


==== Lens epithelium ====
The lens epithelium, located in the anterior portion of the lens between the lens capsule and the lens fibers, is a simple cuboidal epithelium. 

The cells of the lens epithelium regulate most of the homeostatic functions of the lens. 

As ions, nutrients, and liquid enter the lens from the aqueous humor, Na+/K+-ATPase pumps in the lens epithelial cells pump ions out of the lens to maintain appropriate lens osmotic concentration and volume, with equatorially positioned lens epithelium cells contributing most to this current. 

The activity of the Na+/K+-ATPases keeps water and current flowing through the lens from the poles and exiting through the equatorial regions.

The cells of the lens epithelium also serve as the progenitors for new lens fibers. 

It constantly lays down fibers in the embryo, fetus, infant, and adult, and continues to lay down fibers for lifelong growth.


==== Lens fibers ====

The lens fibers form the bulk of the lens. 

They are long, thin, transparent cells, firmly packed, with diameters typically 4–7 micrometres and lengths of up to 12 mm long. 

The lens fibers stretch lengthwise from the posterior to the anterior poles and, when cut horizontally, are arranged in concentric layers rather like the layers of an onion. 

If cut along the equator, it appears as a honeycomb. 

The middle of each fiber lies on the equator. 

These tightly packed layers of lens fibers are referred to as laminae. 

The lens fibers are linked together via gap junctions and interdigitations of the cells that resemble "ball and socket" forms.

The lens is split into regions depending on the age of the lens fibers of a particular layer. 

Moving outwards from the central, oldest layer, the lens is split into an embryonic nucleus, the fetal nucleus, the adult nucleus, and the outer cortex. 

New lens fibers, generated from the lens epithelium, are added to the outer cortex. 

Mature lens fibers have no organelles or nuclei.


=== Development ===

Development of the human lens begins at the 4 mm embryonic stage. 

Unlike the rest of the eye, which is derived mostly from the neural ectoderm, the lens is derived from the surface ectoderm. 

The first stage of lens differentiation takes place when the optic vesicle, which is formed from outpocketings in the neural ectoderm, comes in proximity to the surface ectoderm. 

The optic vesicle induces nearby surface ectoderm to form the lens placode. 

At the 4 mm stage, the lens placode is a single monolayer of columnar cells.

As development progresses, the lens placode begins to deepen and invaginate. 

As the placode continues to deepen, the opening to the surface ectoderm constricts and the lens cells forms a structure known as the lens vesicle. 

By the 10 mm stage, the lens vesicle has completely separated from the surface ectoderm.

After the 10 mm stage, signals from the developing neural retina induces the cells closest to the posterior end of the lens vesicle begin to elongate toward the anterior end of the vesicle. 

These signals also induce the synthesis of crystallins. 

These elongating cells eventually fill in the lumen of the vesicle to form the primary fibers, which become the embryonic nucleus in the mature lens. 

The cells of the anterior portion of the lens vesicle give rise to the lens epithelium.

Additional secondary fibers are derived from lens epithelial cells located toward the equatorial region of the lens. 

These cells lengthen anteriorly and posteriorly to encircle the primary fibers. 

The new fibers grow longer than those of the primary layer, but as the lens gets larger, the ends of the newer fibers cannot reach the posterior or anterior poles of the lens. 

The lens fibers that do not reach the poles form tight, interdigitating seams with neighboring fibers. 

These seams are readily visible and are termed sutures. 

The suture patterns become more complex as more layers of lens fibers are added to the outer portion of the lens.

The lens continues to grow after birth, with the new secondary fibers being added as outer layers. 

New lens fibers are generated from the equatorial cells of the lens epithelium, in a region referred to as the germinative zone. 

The lens epithelial cells elongate, lose contact with the capsule and epithelium, synthesize crystallin, and then finally lose their nuclei (enucleate) as they become mature lens fibers. 

From development through early adulthood, the addition of secondary lens fibers results in the lens growing more ellipsoid in shape; after about age 20, however, the lens grows rounder with time and the iris is very important for this development.Several proteins control the embryonic development of the lens: among these, primarily, PAX6, considered the master regulator gene of this organ. 

Other effectors of proper lens development include the Wnt signaling components BCL9 and Pygo2.


=== Variation ===

In many aquatic vertebrates, the lens is considerably thicker, almost spherical, to increase the refraction. 

This difference compensates for the smaller angle of refraction between the eye's cornea and the watery medium, as they have similar refractive indices. 

Even among terrestrial animals, however, the lens of primates such as humans is unusually flat.In reptiles and birds, the ciliary body touches the lens with a number of pads on its inner surface, in addition to the zonular fibres. 

These pads compress and release the lens to modify its shape while focusing on objects at different distances; the zonular fibres perform this function in mammals. 

In fish and amphibians, the lens is fixed in shape, and focusing is instead achieved by moving the lens forwards or backwards within the eye.In cartilaginous fish, the zonular fibres are replaced by a membrane, including a small muscle at the underside of the lens. 

This muscle pulls the lens forward from its relaxed position when focusing on nearby objects. 

In teleosts, by contrast, a muscle projects from a vascular structure in the floor of the eye, called the falciform process, and serves to pull the lens backwards from the relaxed position to focus on distant objects. 

While amphibians move the lens forward, as do cartilaginous fish, the muscles involved are not homologous with those of either type of fish. 

In frogs, there are two muscles, one above and one below the lens, while other amphibians have only the lower muscle.

In the most primitive vertebrates, the lampreys and hagfish, the lens is not attached to the outer surface of the eyeball at all. 

There is no aqueous humor in these fish, and the vitreous body simply presses the lens against the surface of the cornea. 

To focus its eyes, a lamprey flattens the cornea using muscles outside of the eye and pushes the lens backwards.


== Function ==

=== Accommodation ===


The lens is flexible and its curvature is controlled by ciliary muscles through the zonules. 

By changing the curvature of the lens, one can focus the eye on objects at different distances from it. 

This process is called accommodation. 

At short focal distance the ciliary muscle contracts, zonule fibers loosen, and the lens thickens, resulting in a rounder shape and thus higher refractive power. 

Changing focus to an object at a greater distance requires the relaxation of the lens and thus increasing the focal distance.

The refractive index of human lens varies from approximately 1.406 in the central layers down to 1.386 in less dense layers of the lens. 

This index gradient enhances the optical power of the lens.

Aquatic animals must rely entirely on their lens for both focusing and to provide almost the entire refractive power of the eye as the water-cornea interface does not have a large enough difference in indices of refraction to provide significant refractive power. 

As such, lenses in aquatic eyes tend to be much rounder and harder.


=== Crystallins and transparency ===

Crystallins are water-soluble proteins that compose over 90% of the protein within the lens. 

The three main crystallin types found in the human eye are α-, β-, and γ-crystallins. 

Crystallins tend to form soluble, high-molecular weight aggregates that pack tightly in lens fibers, thus increasing the index of refraction of the lens while maintaining its transparency. β and γ crystallins are found primarily in the lens, while subunits of α -crystallin have been isolated from other parts of the eye and the body. α-crystallin proteins belong to a larger superfamily of molecular chaperone proteins, and so it is believed that the crystallin proteins were evolutionarily recruited from chaperone proteins for optical purposes. 

The chaperone functions of α-crystallin may also help maintain the lens proteins, which must last a human for their entire lifetime.

Another important factor in maintaining the transparency of the lens is the absence of light-scattering organelles such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria within the mature lens fibers. 

Lens fibers also have a very extensive cytoskeleton that maintains the precise shape and packing of the lens fibers; disruptions/mutations in certain cytoskeletal elements can lead to the loss of transparency.

The lens blocks most ultraviolet light in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm; shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea. 

The pigment responsible for blocking the light is 3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside, a product of tryptophan catabolism in the lens epithelium. 

High intensity ultraviolet light can harm the retina, and artificial intraocular lenses are therefore manufactured to also block ultraviolet light. 

People lacking a lens (a condition known as aphakia) perceive ultraviolet light as whitish blue or whitish-violet.


=== Nourishment ===

The lens is metabolically active and requires nourishment in order to maintain its growth and transparency. 

Compared to other tissues in the eye, however, the lens has considerably lower energy demands.By nine weeks into human development, the lens is surrounded and nourished by a net of vessels, the tunica vasculosa lentis, which is derived from the hyaloid artery. 

Beginning in the fourth month of development, the hyaloid artery and its related vasculature begin to atrophy and completely disappear by birth. 

In the postnatal eye, Cloquet's canal marks the former location of the hyaloid artery.
After regression of the hyaloid artery, the lens receives all its nourishment from the aqueous humor. 

Nutrients diffuse in and waste diffuses out through a constant flow of fluid from the anterior/posterior poles of the lens and out of the equatorial regions, a dynamic that is maintained by the Na+/K+-ATPase pumps located in the equatorially positioned cells of the lens epithelium.Glucose is the primary energy source for the lens. 

As mature lens fibers do not have mitochondria, approximately 80% of the glucose is metabolized via anaerobic metabolism. 

The remaining fraction of glucose is shunted primarily down the pentose phosphate pathway. 

The lack of aerobic respiration means that the lens consumes very little oxygen as well.


== Clinical significance ==

Cataracts are opacities of the lens. 

While some are small and do not require any treatment, others may be large enough to block light and obstruct vision. 

Cataracts usually develop as the aging lens becomes more and more opaque, but cataracts can also form congenitally or after injury to the lens. 

Nuclear sclerosis is a type of age-related cataract. 

Diabetes is another risk factor for cataract. 

Cataract surgery involves the removal of the lens and insertion of an artificial intraocular lens.

Presbyopia is the age-related loss of accommodation, which is marked by the inability of the eye to focus on nearby objects. 

The exact mechanism is still unknown, but age-related changes in the hardness, shape, and size of the lens have all been linked to the condition.

Ectopia lentis is the displacement of the lens from its normal position.

Aphakia is the absence of the lens from the eye. 

Aphakia can be the result of surgery or injury, or it can be congenital.

LENTE


El cristalino es una estructura biconvexa transparente en el ojo que, junto con la córnea, ayuda a refractar la luz para enfocarla en la retina.

Al cambiar de forma, funciona para cambiar la distancia focal del ojo para que pueda enfocar objetos a varias distancias, lo que permite que se forme en la retina una imagen real nítida del objeto de interés.

Este ajuste de la lente se conoce como acomodación (ver también más abajo).

La acomodación es similar al enfoque de una cámara fotográfica a través del movimiento de sus lentes.

El cristalino es más plano en su cara anterior que en su cara posterior.
El cristalino también se conoce como aquula (en latín, un pequeño arroyo, dim. de aqua, agua) o cristalino.

En los seres humanos, el poder de refracción del cristalino en su entorno natural es de aproximadamente 18 dioptrías, aproximadamente un tercio del poder total del ojo.


== Estructura ==

El cristalino forma parte del segmento anterior del ojo humano.

Delante del cristalino está el iris, que regula la cantidad de luz que entra en el ojo.

El cristalino está suspendido en su lugar por el ligamento suspensorio del cristalino, un anillo de tejido fibroso que se adhiere al cristalino en su ecuador y lo conecta con el cuerpo ciliar.

Posterior al cristalino se encuentra el cuerpo vítreo que, junto con el humor acuoso de la superficie anterior, baña el cristalino.

La lente tiene una forma elipsoide, biconvexa.

La superficie anterior es menos curva que la posterior.

En el adulto, el cristalino suele tener alrededor de 10 mm de diámetro y una longitud axial de unos 4 mm, aunque es importante tener en cuenta que el tamaño y la forma pueden cambiar debido a la acomodación y porque el cristalino continúa creciendo a lo largo de la vida de una persona. .


=== Microanatomía ===

El cristalino tiene tres partes principales: la cápsula del cristalino, el epitelio del cristalino y las fibras del cristalino.

La cápsula del cristalino forma la capa más externa del cristalino y las fibras del cristalino forman la mayor parte del interior del cristalino.

Las células del epitelio del cristalino, ubicadas entre la cápsula del cristalino y la capa más externa de las fibras del cristalino, se encuentran solo en el lado anterior del cristalino.

El cristalino en sí mismo carece de nervios, vasos sanguíneos o tejido conectivo.


==== Cápsula de lente ====
La cápsula del cristalino es una membrana basal lisa y transparente que rodea completamente el cristalino.

La cápsula es elástica y está compuesta de colágeno.

Es sintetizado por el epitelio del cristalino y sus componentes principales son el colágeno tipo IV y los glicosaminoglicanos sulfatados (GAG).

La cápsula es muy elástica y permite que el cristalino asuma una forma más esférica cuando no está bajo la tensión de las fibras zonulares (también llamadas ligamentos suspensorios), que conectan la cápsula del cristalino con el cuerpo ciliar.

La cápsula varía de 2 a 28 micrómetros de espesor, siendo más gruesa cerca del ecuador y más delgada cerca del polo posterior.


==== Epitelio del cristalino ====
El epitelio del cristalino, ubicado en la porción anterior del cristalino entre la cápsula del cristalino y las fibras del cristalino, es un epitelio cúbico simple.

Las células del epitelio del cristalino regulan la mayoría de las funciones homeostáticas del cristalino.

A medida que los iones, los nutrientes y el líquido ingresan al cristalino desde el humor acuoso, las bombas Na+/K+-ATPasa en las células epiteliales del cristalino bombean iones fuera del cristalino para mantener la concentración y el volumen osmóticos apropiados del cristalino, y las células del epitelio del cristalino ubicadas ecuatorialmente contribuyen más a esta corriente 

La actividad de las Na+/K+-ATPasas mantiene el agua y la corriente fluyendo a través de la lente desde los polos y saliendo por las regiones ecuatoriales.

Las células del epitelio del cristalino también sirven como progenitores de nuevas fibras del cristalino. 

Establece fibras constantemente en el embrión, el feto, el bebé y el adulto, y continúa depositando fibras para el crecimiento de por vida.


==== Fibras de lentes ====

Las fibras del cristalino forman la mayor parte del cristalino. 

Son células largas, delgadas y transparentes, empaquetadas firmemente, con diámetros típicamente de 4 a 7 micrómetros y longitudes de hasta 12 mm. 

Las fibras del cristalino se extienden a lo largo desde el polo posterior hasta el anterior y, cuando se cortan horizontalmente, se disponen en capas concéntricas como las capas de una cebolla. 

Si se corta a lo largo del ecuador, aparece como un panal. 

El centro de cada fibra se encuentra en el ecuador. 

Estas capas apretadas de fibras de lentes se denominan láminas. 

Las fibras del cristalino están unidas entre sí a través de uniones comunicantes e interdigitaciones de las células que se asemejan a formas de "bola y cavidad".

La lente se divide en regiones dependiendo de la edad de las fibras de la lente de una capa particular. 

Moviéndose hacia afuera desde la capa central más antigua, la lente se divide en un núcleo embrionario, el núcleo fetal, el núcleo adulto y la corteza externa. 

Las nuevas fibras del cristalino, generadas a partir del epitelio del cristalino, se añaden a la corteza exterior. 

Las fibras maduras del cristalino no tienen orgánulos ni núcleos.


=== Desarrollo ===

El desarrollo del cristalino humano comienza en la etapa embrionaria de 4 mm.

A diferencia del resto del ojo, que se deriva principalmente del ectodermo neural, el cristalino se deriva del ectodermo superficial.

La primera etapa de la diferenciación del cristalino tiene lugar cuando la vesícula óptica, que se forma a partir de bolsas en el ectodermo neural, se acerca al ectodermo superficial.

La vesícula óptica induce al ectodermo superficial cercano a formar la placoda del cristalino.

En la etapa de 4 mm, la placoda del cristalino es una sola monocapa de células columnares.

A medida que avanza el desarrollo, la placoda del cristalino comienza a profundizarse e invaginarse.

A medida que la placoda continúa profundizándose, la abertura hacia el ectodermo superficial se contrae y las células del cristalino forman una estructura conocida como vesícula del cristalino.

En la etapa de 10 mm, la vesícula del cristalino se ha separado completamente del ectodermo superficial.

Después de la etapa de 10 mm, las señales de la retina neural en desarrollo inducen que las células más cercanas al extremo posterior de la vesícula del cristalino comiencen a alargarse hacia el extremo anterior de la vesícula. 

Estas señales también inducen la síntesis de cristalinas. 

Estas células que se alargan finalmente llenan la luz de la vesícula para formar las fibras primarias, que se convierten en el núcleo embrionario en el cristalino maduro. 

Las células de la porción anterior de la vesícula del cristalino dan origen al epitelio del cristalino.

Las fibras secundarias adicionales se derivan de las células epiteliales del cristalino ubicadas hacia la región ecuatorial del cristalino. 

Estas células se alargan anterior y posteriormente para rodear las fibras primarias. 

Las nuevas fibras crecen más que las de la capa primaria, pero a medida que el cristalino crece, los extremos de las fibras más nuevas no pueden alcanzar los polos posterior o anterior del cristalino. 

Las fibras del cristalino que no llegan a los polos forman costuras estrechas e interdigitadas con las fibras vecinas.

Estas costuras son fácilmente visibles y se denominan suturas.

Los patrones de sutura se vuelven más complejos a medida que se añaden más capas de fibras del cristalino a la parte exterior del cristalino.

El cristalino continúa creciendo después del nacimiento, y las nuevas fibras secundarias se agregan como capas externas.

Las nuevas fibras del cristalino se generan a partir de las células ecuatoriales del epitelio del cristalino, en una región denominada zona germinativa.

Las células epiteliales del cristalino se alargan, pierden contacto con la cápsula y el epitelio, sintetizan cristalina y finalmente pierden sus núcleos (enuclean) a medida que se convierten en fibras maduras del cristalino.

Desde el desarrollo hasta la edad adulta temprana, la adición de fibras secundarias del cristalino hace que el cristalino adquiera una forma más elipsoide; después de los 20 años, sin embargo, el cristalino se vuelve más redondo con el tiempo y el iris es muy importante para este desarrollo. Varias proteínas controlan el desarrollo embrionario del cristalino: entre ellas, principalmente, PAX6, considerado el gen regulador maestro de este órgano.

Otros efectores del desarrollo adecuado de la lente incluyen los componentes de señalización Wnt BCL9 y Pygo2.


=== Variación ===

En muchos vertebrados acuáticos, el cristalino es considerablemente más grueso, casi esférico, para aumentar la refracción. 

Esta diferencia compensa el menor ángulo de refracción entre la córnea del ojo y el medio acuoso, ya que tienen índices de refracción similares. 

Sin embargo, incluso entre los animales terrestres, el cristalino de primates como los humanos es inusualmente plano. En reptiles y aves, el cuerpo ciliar toca el cristalino con varias almohadillas en su superficie interna, además de las fibras zonulares. 

Estas almohadillas comprimen y liberan la lente para modificar su forma mientras enfoca objetos a diferentes distancias; las fibras zonales realizan esta función en los mamíferos.

En peces y anfibios, el cristalino tiene una forma fija y, en cambio, el enfoque se logra moviendo el cristalino hacia adelante o hacia atrás dentro del ojo. En los peces cartilaginosos, las fibras zonulares se reemplazan por una membrana, que incluye un pequeño músculo en la parte inferior del ojo. lente. 

Este músculo empuja la lente hacia adelante desde su posición relajada cuando enfoca objetos cercanos. 

En los teleósteos, por el contrario, un músculo se proyecta desde una estructura vascular en el suelo del ojo, llamada apófisis falciforme, y sirve para tirar del cristalino hacia atrás desde la posición relajada para enfocar objetos distantes.

Mientras que los anfibios mueven el cristalino hacia adelante, al igual que los peces cartilaginosos, los músculos involucrados no son homólogos a los de ninguno de los dos tipos de peces.

En las ranas, hay dos músculos, uno arriba y otro debajo del cristalino, mientras que otros anfibios solo tienen el músculo inferior.

En los vertebrados más primitivos, las lampreas y los mixinos, el cristalino no está adherido en absoluto a la superficie exterior del globo ocular.

No hay humor acuoso en estos peces, y el cuerpo vítreo simplemente presiona el cristalino contra la superficie de la córnea.

Para enfocar sus ojos, una lamprea aplana la córnea usando músculos fuera del ojo y empuja la lente hacia atrás.


== Función ==

=== Alojamiento ===


El cristalino es flexible y su curvatura está controlada por los músculos ciliares a través de las zónulas.

Al cambiar la curvatura de la lente, uno puede enfocar el ojo en objetos a diferentes distancias de ella.

Este proceso se llama acomodación.

A una distancia focal corta, el músculo ciliar se contrae, las fibras de la zónula se aflojan y el cristalino se engrosa, lo que da como resultado una forma más redonda y, por lo tanto, un mayor poder de refracción.

Cambiar el enfoque a un objeto a una distancia mayor requiere la relajación de la lente y, por lo tanto, aumentar la distancia focal.

El índice de refracción del cristalino humano varía desde aproximadamente 1,406 en las capas centrales hasta 1,386 en las capas menos densas del cristalino.

Este gradiente de índice mejora la potencia óptica de la lente.

Los animales acuáticos deben depender completamente de su lente tanto para enfocar como para proporcionar casi todo el poder de refracción del ojo, ya que la interfaz agua-córnea no tiene una diferencia lo suficientemente grande en los índices de refracción para proporcionar un poder de refracción significativo. 

Como tal, las lentes de los ojos acuáticos tienden a ser mucho más redondas y duras.


=== Cristalinas y transparencia ===

Los cristalinos son proteínas solubles en agua que componen más del 90 % de la proteína dentro del cristalino. 

Los tres tipos principales de cristales que se encuentran en el ojo humano son los cristales α, β y γ. 

Los cristalinos tienden a formar agregados solubles de alto peso molecular que se empaquetan estrechamente en las fibras de la lente, lo que aumenta el índice de refracción de la lente y mantiene su transparencia. Los cristalinos β y γ se encuentran principalmente en el cristalino, mientras que las subunidades de cristalino α se han aislado de otras partes del ojo y del cuerpo. Las proteínas α-cristalinas pertenecen a una superfamilia más grande de proteínas chaperonas moleculares, por lo que se cree que las proteínas cristalinas se reclutaron evolutivamente a partir de proteínas chaperonas con fines ópticos.

Las funciones de chaperona de la α-cristalina también pueden ayudar a mantener las proteínas del cristalino, que deben durar toda la vida de un ser humano.

Otro factor importante para mantener la transparencia del cristalino es la ausencia de orgánulos que dispersen la luz, como el núcleo, el retículo endoplásmico y las mitocondrias dentro de las fibras maduras del cristalino.

Las fibras del cristalino también tienen un citoesqueleto muy extenso que mantiene la forma precisa y el empaquetamiento de las fibras del cristalino; las interrupciones/mutaciones en ciertos elementos del citoesqueleto pueden conducir a la pérdida de transparencia.

La lente bloquea la mayor parte de la luz ultravioleta en el rango de longitud de onda de 300 a 400 nm; las longitudes de onda más cortas son bloqueadas por la córnea.

El pigmento responsable de bloquear la luz es el glucósido de 3-hidroxiquinurenina, un producto del catabolismo del triptófano en el epitelio del cristalino.

La luz ultravioleta de alta intensidad puede dañar la retina y, por lo tanto, se fabrican lentes intraoculares artificiales para bloquear también la luz ultravioleta.

Las personas que carecen de un cristalino (una condición conocida como afaquia) perciben la luz ultravioleta como azul blanquecino o violeta blanquecino.


=== Nutrición ===

El cristalino es metabólicamente activo y requiere nutrición para mantener su crecimiento y transparencia.

Sin embargo, en comparación con otros tejidos del ojo, el cristalino tiene demandas de energía considerablemente menores. A las nueve semanas del desarrollo humano, el cristalino está rodeado y alimentado por una red de vasos, la túnica vasculosa lentis, que se deriva de la arteria hialoidea.

A partir del cuarto mes de desarrollo, la arteria hialoidea y su vasculatura relacionada comienzan a atrofiarse y desaparecen por completo al nacer.

En el ojo posnatal, el canal de Cloquet marca la ubicación anterior de la arteria hialoidea.
Después de la regresión de la arteria hialoidea, el cristalino recibe toda su nutrición del humor acuoso.

Los nutrientes se difunden y los desechos se difunden a través de un flujo constante de líquido desde los polos anterior/posterior del cristalino y fuera de las regiones ecuatoriales, una dinámica que es mantenida por las bombas de Na+/K+-ATPasa ubicadas en las células posicionadas ecuatoriales del cristalino. epitelio del cristalino. La glucosa es la principal fuente de energía del cristalino. 

Como las fibras maduras del cristalino no tienen mitocondrias, aproximadamente el 80 % de la glucosa se metaboliza a través del metabolismo anaeróbico. 

La fracción restante de glucosa se desvía principalmente por la vía de las pentosas fosfato. 

La falta de respiración aeróbica significa que el cristalino también consume muy poco oxígeno.


== Importancia clínica ==

Las cataratas son opacidades del cristalino. 

Mientras que algunos son pequeños y no requieren ningún tratamiento, otros pueden ser lo suficientemente grandes como para bloquear la luz y obstruir la visión. 

Las cataratas generalmente se desarrollan a medida que el cristalino envejece y se vuelve más y más opaco, pero las cataratas también pueden formarse congénitamente o después de una lesión en el cristalino.

La esclerosis nuclear es un tipo de catarata relacionada con la edad.

La diabetes es otro factor de riesgo para la catarata.

La cirugía de cataratas consiste en la extracción del cristalino y la inserción de un lente intraocular artificial.

La presbicia es la pérdida de acomodación relacionada con la edad, que se caracteriza por la incapacidad del ojo para enfocar objetos cercanos.

El mecanismo exacto aún se desconoce, pero los cambios relacionados con la edad en la dureza, la forma y el tamaño del cristalino se han relacionado con la afección.

La ectopia lentis es el desplazamiento del cristalino de su posición normal.

La afaquia es la ausencia del cristalino del ojo.

La afaquia puede ser el resultado de una cirugía o lesión, o puede ser congénita.

LENTILLE


Le cristallin est une structure biconvexe transparente dans l'œil qui, avec la cornée, aide à réfracter la lumière pour la focaliser sur la rétine. 

En changeant de forme, il fonctionne pour changer la distance focale de l'œil afin qu'il puisse se concentrer sur des objets à différentes distances, permettant ainsi à une image réelle nette de l'objet d'intérêt de se former sur la rétine. 

Cet ajustement de l'objectif est connu sous le nom d'accommodation (voir également ci-dessous). 

L'accommodation est similaire à la mise au point d'un appareil photo via le mouvement de ses objectifs. 

Le cristallin est plus plat sur sa face antérieure que sur sa face postérieure.
Le cristallin est également connu sous le nom d'aquula (latin, petit ruisseau, dim. d'aqua, eau) ou cristallin. 

Chez l'homme, la puissance de réfraction du cristallin dans son environnement naturel est d'environ 18 dioptries, soit environ un tiers de la puissance totale de l'œil.


== Structure ==

Le cristallin fait partie du segment antérieur de l'œil humain.

Devant la lentille se trouve l'iris, qui régule la quantité de lumière entrant dans l'œil.

Le cristallin est suspendu en place par le ligament suspenseur du cristallin, un anneau de tissu fibreux qui s'attache au cristallin à son équateur et le relie au corps ciliaire.

En arrière du cristallin se trouve le corps vitré qui, avec l'humeur aqueuse sur la surface antérieure, baigne le cristallin.

La lentille a une forme ellipsoïde et biconvexe.

La face antérieure est moins courbée que la postérieure.

Chez l'adulte, le cristallin mesure généralement environ 10 mm de diamètre et a une longueur axiale d'environ 4 mm, bien qu'il soit important de noter que la taille et la forme peuvent changer en raison de l'accommodation et parce que le cristallin continue de croître tout au long de la vie d'une personne. .


=== Microanatomie ===

Le cristallin comporte trois parties principales : la capsule cristallinienne, l'épithélium cristallinien et les fibres cristalliniennes.

La capsule cristallinienne forme la couche la plus externe de la lentille et les fibres de la lentille forment la majeure partie de l'intérieur de la lentille.

Les cellules de l'épithélium du cristallin, situées entre la capsule du cristallin et la couche la plus externe des fibres du cristallin, se trouvent uniquement sur la face antérieure du cristallin.

Le cristallin lui-même est dépourvu de nerfs, de vaisseaux sanguins ou de tissu conjonctif.


==== Capsule d'objectif ====
La capsule du cristallin est une membrane basale lisse et transparente qui entoure complètement le cristallin.

La capsule est élastique et est composée de collagène.

Il est synthétisé par l'épithélium du cristallin et ses principaux composants sont le collagène de type IV et les glycosaminoglycanes sulfatés (GAG).

La capsule est très élastique et permet ainsi au cristallin de prendre une forme plus sphérique lorsqu'il n'est pas sous la tension des fibres zonulaires (également appelées ligaments suspenseurs), qui relient la capsule cristallinienne au corps ciliaire.

La capsule varie de 2 à 28 micromètres d'épaisseur, étant la plus épaisse près de l'équateur et la plus mince près du pôle postérieur.


==== Épithélium du cristallin ====
L'épithélium cristallinien, situé dans la partie antérieure du cristallin entre la capsule cristallinienne et les fibres cristalliniennes, est un épithélium cubique simple.

Les cellules de l'épithélium du cristallin régulent la plupart des fonctions homéostatiques du cristallin.

Au fur et à mesure que les ions, les nutriments et le liquide pénètrent dans le cristallin à partir de l'humeur aqueuse, les pompes Na + / K + -ATPase dans les cellules épithéliales du cristallin pompent les ions hors du cristallin pour maintenir une concentration et un volume osmotiques appropriés du cristallin, les cellules épithéliales du cristallin positionnées de manière équatoriale contribuant le plus à ce courant.

L'activité des Na+/K+-ATPases maintient l'eau et le courant traversant la lentille depuis les pôles et sortant par les régions équatoriales.

Les cellules de l'épithélium du cristallin servent également de progéniteurs pour les nouvelles fibres du cristallin.

Il dépose constamment des fibres dans l'embryon, le fœtus, le nourrisson et l'adulte, et continue de déposer des fibres pour une croissance tout au long de la vie.


==== Fibres de lentilles ====

Les fibres de la lentille forment la majeure partie de la lentille.

Ce sont des cellules longues, minces et transparentes, fermement emballées, avec des diamètres généralement de 4 à 7 micromètres et des longueurs allant jusqu'à 12 mm de long.

Les fibres du cristallin s'étendent dans le sens de la longueur du pôle postérieur au pôle antérieur et, lorsqu'elles sont coupées horizontalement, sont disposées en couches concentriques un peu comme les couches d'un oignon.

S'il est coupé le long de l'équateur, il apparaît comme un nid d'abeilles.

Le milieu de chaque fibre se trouve sur l'équateur.

Ces couches serrées de fibres de lentilles sont appelées lamelles.

Les fibres de la lentille sont reliées entre elles par des jonctions lacunaires et des interdigitations des cellules qui ressemblent à des formes de «boule et douille».

La lentille est divisée en régions en fonction de l'âge des fibres de lentille d'une couche particulière.

En s'éloignant de la couche centrale la plus ancienne, le cristallin est divisé en un noyau embryonnaire, le noyau fœtal, le noyau adulte et le cortex externe.

De nouvelles fibres cristalliniennes, générées à partir de l'épithélium cristallinien, sont ajoutées au cortex externe.

Les fibres du cristallin matures n'ont ni organites ni noyaux.


=== Développement ===

Le développement du cristallin humain commence au stade embryonnaire de 4 mm.

Contrairement au reste de l'œil, qui est principalement dérivé de l'ectoderme neural, le cristallin est dérivé de l'ectoderme de surface.

La première étape de la différenciation du cristallin a lieu lorsque la vésicule optique, qui est formée à partir de poches dans l'ectoderme neural, se rapproche de l'ectoderme de surface.

La vésicule optique induit l'ectoderme de surface à proximité pour former la placode de la lentille.

Au stade de 4 mm, la placode de la lentille est une seule monocouche de cellules cylindriques.

Au fur et à mesure que le développement progresse, la placode du cristallin commence à s'approfondir et à s'invaginer.

Au fur et à mesure que la placode continue de s'approfondir, l'ouverture vers la surface de l'ectoderme se resserre et les cellules cristalliniennes forment une structure connue sous le nom de vésicule cristallinienne.

Au stade de 10 mm, la vésicule du cristallin s'est complètement séparée de l'ectoderme de surface.

Après le stade de 10 mm, les signaux de la rétine neurale en développement induisent que les cellules les plus proches de l'extrémité postérieure de la vésicule du cristallin commencent à s'allonger vers l'extrémité antérieure de la vésicule. 

Ces signaux induisent également la synthèse de cristallines. 

Ces cellules allongées finissent par remplir la lumière de la vésicule pour former les fibres primaires, qui deviennent le noyau embryonnaire du cristallin mature. 

Les cellules de la partie antérieure de la vésicule cristallinienne donnent naissance à l'épithélium cristallinien.

Des fibres secondaires supplémentaires sont dérivées des cellules épithéliales du cristallin situées vers la région équatoriale du cristallin. 

Ces cellules s'allongent en avant et en arrière pour encercler les fibres primaires. 

Les nouvelles fibres deviennent plus longues que celles de la couche primaire, mais à mesure que la lentille grossit, les extrémités des nouvelles fibres ne peuvent pas atteindre les pôles postérieur ou antérieur de la lentille. 

Les fibres de la lentille qui n'atteignent pas les pôles forment des coutures serrées et interdigitées avec les fibres voisines.

Ces coutures sont facilement visibles et sont appelées sutures.

Les motifs de suture deviennent plus complexes à mesure que davantage de couches de fibres de lentille sont ajoutées à la partie externe de la lentille.

Le cristallin continue de croître après la naissance, les nouvelles fibres secondaires étant ajoutées en tant que couches externes.

De nouvelles fibres cristalliniennes sont générées à partir des cellules équatoriales de l'épithélium cristallinien, dans une région appelée zone germinative.

Les cellules épithéliales du cristallin s'allongent, perdent le contact avec la capsule et l'épithélium, synthétisent des cristallins, puis perdent finalement leurs noyaux (énucléés) en devenant des fibres cristalliniennes matures.

Du développement jusqu'au début de l'âge adulte, l'ajout de fibres cristalliniennes secondaires donne à la lentille une forme plus ellipsoïdale; après environ 20 ans, cependant, le cristallin s'arrondit avec le temps et l'iris est très important pour ce développement.

D'autres effecteurs du développement correct de la lentille comprennent les composants de signalisation Wnt BCL9 et Pygo2.


=== Variante ===

Chez de nombreux vertébrés aquatiques, la lentille est considérablement plus épaisse, presque sphérique, pour augmenter la réfraction. 

Cette différence compense le plus petit angle de réfraction entre la cornée de l'œil et le milieu aqueux, car ils ont des indices de réfraction similaires. 

Même chez les animaux terrestres, cependant, la lentille des primates tels que les humains est inhabituellement plate. Chez les reptiles et les oiseaux, le corps ciliaire touche la lentille avec un certain nombre de coussinets sur sa surface interne, en plus des fibres zonulaires.

Ces coussinets compriment et relâchent l'objectif pour modifier sa forme tout en faisant la mise au point sur des objets à différentes distances ; les fibres zonulaires remplissent cette fonction chez les mammifères.

Chez les poissons et les amphibiens, la lentille a une forme fixe et la mise au point est obtenue en déplaçant la lentille vers l'avant ou vers l'arrière dans l'œil. Chez les poissons cartilagineux, les fibres zonulaires sont remplacées par une membrane, comprenant un petit muscle à la face inférieure du lentille.

Ce muscle tire l'objectif vers l'avant depuis sa position détendue lors de la mise au point sur des objets proches.

Chez les téléostéens, en revanche, un muscle se projette à partir d'une structure vasculaire dans le plancher de l'œil, appelé processus falciforme, et sert à tirer la lentille vers l'arrière de la position détendue pour se concentrer sur des objets éloignés. 

Alors que les amphibiens déplacent la lentille vers l'avant, comme le font les poissons cartilagineux, les muscles impliqués ne sont pas homologues à ceux de l'un ou l'autre type de poisson. 

Chez les grenouilles, il y a deux muscles, un au-dessus et un en dessous de la lentille, tandis que d'autres amphibiens n'ont que le muscle inférieur.

Chez les vertébrés les plus primitifs, les lamproies et les myxines, le cristallin n'est pas du tout attaché à la surface externe du globe oculaire. 

Il n'y a pas d'humeur aqueuse chez ces poissons et le corps vitré appuie simplement la lentille contre la surface de la cornée. 

Pour focaliser ses yeux, une lamproie aplatit la cornée en utilisant des muscles à l'extérieur de l'œil et pousse la lentille vers l'arrière.


== Fonction ==

=== Hébergement ===


Le cristallin est flexible et sa courbure est contrôlée par les muscles ciliaires à travers les zonules. 

En modifiant la courbure de la lentille, on peut focaliser l'œil sur des objets à différentes distances de celui-ci. 

Ce processus s'appelle l'hébergement. 

À courte distance focale, le muscle ciliaire se contracte, les fibres de la zonule se détendent et le cristallin s'épaissit, ce qui donne une forme plus ronde et donc une puissance de réfraction plus élevée. 

Changer la mise au point sur un objet à une plus grande distance nécessite la relaxation de l'objectif et donc l'augmentation de la distance focale.

L'indice de réfraction du cristallin humain varie d'environ 1,406 dans les couches centrales jusqu'à 1,386 dans les couches moins denses du cristallin. 

Ce gradient d'indice améliore la puissance optique de la lentille.

Les animaux aquatiques doivent compter entièrement sur leur lentille à la fois pour la mise au point et pour fournir la quasi-totalité de la puissance de réfraction de l'œil car l'interface eau-cornée n'a pas une différence suffisamment importante dans les indices de réfraction pour fournir une puissance de réfraction significative. 

Ainsi, les lentilles des yeux aquatiques ont tendance à être beaucoup plus rondes et plus dures.


=== Cristallins et transparence ===

Les cristallines sont des protéines solubles dans l'eau qui composent plus de 90 % des protéines du cristallin. 

Les trois principaux types cristallins trouvés dans l'œil humain sont les cristallins α, β et γ. 

Les cristallins ont tendance à former des agrégats solubles de poids moléculaire élevé qui se tassent étroitement dans les fibres de la lentille, augmentant ainsi l'indice de réfraction de la lentille tout en maintenant sa transparence. Les cristallines β et γ se trouvent principalement dans le cristallin, tandis que des sous-unités de cristalline α ont été isolées d'autres parties de l'œil et du corps. Les protéines α-cristallines appartiennent à une superfamille plus large de protéines chaperons moléculaires, et on pense donc que les protéines cristallines ont été recrutées de manière évolutive à partir de protéines chaperons à des fins optiques.

Les fonctions de chaperon de l'α-cristalline peuvent également aider à maintenir les protéines du cristallin, qui doivent durer toute la vie d'un être humain.

Un autre facteur important dans le maintien de la transparence du cristallin est l'absence d'organites diffusant la lumière tels que le noyau, le réticulum endoplasmique et les mitochondries dans les fibres matures du cristallin.

Les fibres du cristallin ont également un cytosquelette très étendu qui maintient la forme et l'emballage précis des fibres du cristallin; les perturbations/mutations de certains éléments du cytosquelette peuvent entraîner une perte de transparence.

La lentille bloque la plupart des rayons ultraviolets dans la plage de longueurs d'onde de 300 à 400 nm ; les longueurs d'onde plus courtes sont bloquées par la cornée.

Le pigment responsable du blocage de la lumière est le 3-hydroxykynurénine glucoside, un produit du catabolisme du tryptophane dans l'épithélium du cristallin.

La lumière ultraviolette à haute intensité peut endommager la rétine, et les lentilles intraoculaires artificielles sont donc fabriquées pour bloquer également la lumière ultraviolette.

Les personnes dépourvues de lentille (une condition connue sous le nom d'aphakie) perçoivent la lumière ultraviolette comme du bleu blanchâtre ou du violet blanchâtre.


=== Nourriture ===

Le cristallin est métaboliquement actif et a besoin d'être nourri pour maintenir sa croissance et sa transparence. 

Comparé à d'autres tissus de l'œil, cependant, le cristallin a des besoins énergétiques considérablement inférieurs. Après neuf semaines de développement humain, le cristallin est entouré et nourri par un réseau de vaisseaux, la tunica vasculosa lentis, qui est dérivée de l'artère hyaloïde. 

À partir du quatrième mois de développement, l'artère hyaloïde et son système vasculaire associé commencent à s'atrophier et à disparaître complètement à la naissance. 

Dans l'œil postnatal, le canal de Cloquet marque l'ancien emplacement de l'artère hyaloïde.
Après régression de l'artère hyaloïde, le cristallin reçoit toute sa nourriture de l'humeur aqueuse. 

Les nutriments se diffusent à l'intérieur et les déchets se diffusent à travers un flux constant de fluide depuis les pôles antérieur/postérieur de la lentille et hors des régions équatoriales, une dynamique qui est maintenue par les pompes Na+/K+-ATPase situées dans les cellules en position équatoriale du cristallin. épithélium du cristallin. Le glucose est la principale source d'énergie du cristallin.

Comme les fibres matures du cristallin n'ont pas de mitochondries, environ 80 % du glucose est métabolisé via le métabolisme anaérobie.

La fraction restante de glucose est dérivée principalement par la voie des pentoses phosphates.

L'absence de respiration aérobie signifie que le cristallin consomme également très peu d'oxygène.


== Signification clinique ==

Les cataractes sont des opacités du cristallin.

Alors que certains sont petits et ne nécessitent aucun traitement, d'autres peuvent être assez grands pour bloquer la lumière et obstruer la vision.

Les cataractes se développent généralement lorsque le cristallin vieillissant devient de plus en plus opaque, mais les cataractes peuvent également se former de manière congénitale ou après une blessure au cristallin. 

La sclérose nucléaire est un type de cataracte liée à l'âge. 

Le diabète est un autre facteur de risque de cataracte. 

La chirurgie de la cataracte implique le retrait du cristallin et l'insertion d'une lentille intraoculaire artificielle.

La presbytie est la perte d'accommodation liée à l'âge, qui se caractérise par l'incapacité de l'œil à se concentrer sur les objets proches. 

Le mécanisme exact est encore inconnu, mais les changements liés à l'âge dans la dureté, la forme et la taille de la lentille ont tous été liés à la condition.

L'ectopie du cristallin est le déplacement du cristallin de sa position normale.

L'aphakie est l'absence du cristallin de l'œil. 

L'aphakie peut être le résultat d'une intervention chirurgicale ou d'une blessure, ou elle peut être congénitale.

LENTE


A lente é uma estrutura transparente biconvexa no olho que, juntamente com a córnea, ajuda a refratar a luz para ser focada na retina. 

Ao mudar de forma, ele funciona para alterar a distância focal do olho para que ele possa focalizar objetos em várias distâncias, permitindo assim que uma imagem real nítida do objeto de interesse seja formada na retina. 

Este ajuste da lente é conhecido como acomodação (veja também abaixo). 

A acomodação é semelhante à focalização de uma câmera fotográfica através do movimento de suas lentes. 

A lente é mais plana em seu lado anterior do que em seu lado posterior.
A lente também é conhecida como aquula (latim, um pequeno fluxo, dim. de aqua, água) ou lente cristalina. 

Em humanos, o poder de refração da lente em seu ambiente natural é de aproximadamente 18 dioptrias, aproximadamente um terço do poder total do olho.


== Estrutura ==

A lente faz parte do segmento anterior do olho humano. 

Na frente da lente está a íris, que regula a quantidade de luz que entra no olho. 

A lente é suspensa no lugar pelo ligamento suspensor da lente, um anel de tecido fibroso que se liga à lente em seu equador e a conecta ao corpo ciliar. 

Posteriormente ao cristalino está o corpo vítreo, que, juntamente com o humor aquoso na superfície anterior, banha o cristalino. 

A lente tem uma forma elipsóide, biconvexa. 

A superfície anterior é menos curva que a posterior. 

No adulto, a lente tem tipicamente cerca de 10 mm de diâmetro e tem um comprimento axial de cerca de 4 mm, embora seja importante notar que o tamanho e a forma podem mudar devido à acomodação e porque a lente continua a crescer ao longo da vida de uma pessoa. .


=== Microanatomia ===

A lente tem três partes principais: a cápsula da lente, o epitélio da lente e as fibras da lente. 

A cápsula da lente forma a camada mais externa da lente e as fibras da lente formam a maior parte do interior da lente. 

As células do epitélio do cristalino, localizadas entre a cápsula do cristalino e a camada mais externa das fibras do cristalino, são encontradas apenas no lado anterior do cristalino. 

A própria lente não tem nervos, vasos sanguíneos ou tecido conjuntivo.


==== Cápsula da lente ====
A cápsula da lente é uma membrana basal lisa e transparente que envolve completamente a lente. 

A cápsula é elástica e é composta de colágeno. 

É sintetizado pelo epitélio do cristalino e seus principais componentes são o colágeno tipo IV e os glicosaminoglicanos sulfatados (GAGs). 

A cápsula é muito elástica e, portanto, permite que o cristalino assuma uma forma mais esférica quando não está sob a tensão das fibras zonulares (também chamadas de ligamentos suspensores), que conectam a cápsula do cristalino ao corpo ciliar.

A cápsula varia de 2 a 28 micrômetros de espessura, sendo mais espessa próximo ao equador e mais fina próximo ao pólo posterior.


==== Epitélio do cristalino ====
O epitélio do cristalino, localizado na porção anterior do cristalino entre a cápsula do cristalino e as fibras do cristalino, é um epitélio cúbico simples.

As células do epitélio do cristalino regulam a maioria das funções homeostáticas do cristalino.

À medida que íons, nutrientes e líquido entram no cristalino a partir do humor aquoso, as bombas Na+/K+-ATPase nas células epiteliais do cristalino bombeiam íons para fora do cristalino para manter a concentração e o volume osmóticos apropriados do cristalino, com as células equatorialmente posicionadas do epitélio do cristalino contribuindo mais para esta corrente.

A atividade das Na+/K+-ATPases mantém a água e a corrente fluindo através da lente dos polos e saindo pelas regiões equatoriais.

As células do epitélio do cristalino também servem como progenitores para novas fibras do cristalino.

Constantemente deposita fibras no embrião, feto, bebê e adulto, e continua a depositar fibras para o crescimento ao longo da vida.


==== Fibras da lente ====

As fibras da lente formam a maior parte da lente.

São células longas, finas e transparentes, firmemente compactadas, com diâmetros tipicamente de 4 a 7 micrômetros e comprimentos de até 12 mm de comprimento.

As fibras do cristalino se estendem longitudinalmente do pólo posterior ao anterior e, quando cortadas horizontalmente, são dispostas em camadas concêntricas, como as camadas de uma cebola. 

Se cortada ao longo do equador, aparece como um favo de mel. 

O meio de cada fibra fica no equador. 

Essas camadas bem compactadas de fibras da lente são chamadas de lâminas. 

As fibras da lente estão ligadas entre si por meio de junções comunicantes e interdigitações das células que se assemelham a formas de "bola e soquete".

A lente é dividida em regiões dependendo da idade das fibras da lente de uma camada particular. 

Movendo-se para fora da camada central, mais antiga, o cristalino é dividido em um núcleo embrionário, o núcleo fetal, o núcleo adulto e o córtex externo. 

Novas fibras do cristalino, geradas a partir do epitélio do cristalino, são adicionadas ao córtex externo. 

As fibras do cristalino maduro não possuem organelas ou núcleos.


=== Desenvolvimento ===

O desenvolvimento do cristalino humano começa no estágio embrionário de 4 mm. 

Ao contrário do resto do olho, que é derivado principalmente do ectoderma neural, o cristalino é derivado do ectoderma superficial. 

O primeiro estágio de diferenciação do cristalino ocorre quando a vesícula óptica, que é formada a partir de bolsas no ectoderma neural, se aproxima do ectoderma superficial. 

A vesícula óptica induz o ectoderma da superfície próxima para formar o placódio da lente. 

No estágio de 4 mm, o placódio da lente é uma única monocamada de células colunares.

À medida que o desenvolvimento progride, o placódio da lente começa a se aprofundar e invaginar. 

À medida que o placódio continua a se aprofundar, a abertura para o ectoderma da superfície se contrai e as células do cristalino formam uma estrutura conhecida como vesícula do cristalino. 

No estágio de 10 mm, a vesícula do cristalino se separou completamente do ectoderma superficial.

Após o estágio de 10 mm, os sinais da retina neural em desenvolvimento induzem as células mais próximas da extremidade posterior da vesícula do cristalino a se alongarem em direção à extremidade anterior da vesícula.

Esses sinais também induzem a síntese de cristalinas.

Essas células alongadas eventualmente preenchem o lúmen da vesícula para formar as fibras primárias, que se tornam o núcleo embrionário no cristalino maduro.

As células da porção anterior da vesícula do cristalino dão origem ao epitélio do cristalino.

Fibras secundárias adicionais são derivadas de células epiteliais do cristalino localizadas em direção à região equatorial do cristalino.

Essas células se alongam anterior e posteriormente para circundar as fibras primárias.

As novas fibras crescem mais do que as da camada primária, mas à medida que a lente fica maior, as extremidades das fibras mais novas não podem alcançar os pólos posterior ou anterior da lente.

As fibras da lente que não atingem os pólos formam costuras apertadas e interdigitantes com as fibras vizinhas.

Essas costuras são facilmente visíveis e são denominadas suturas.

Os padrões de sutura tornam-se mais complexos à medida que mais camadas de fibras da lente são adicionadas à parte externa da lente.

A lente continua a crescer após o nascimento, com as novas fibras secundárias sendo adicionadas como camadas externas.

Novas fibras do cristalino são geradas a partir das células equatoriais do epitélio do cristalino, em uma região denominada zona germinativa.

As células epiteliais do cristalino se alongam, perdem contato com a cápsula e o epitélio, sintetizam a cristalina e, finalmente, perdem seus núcleos (enucleados) à medida que se tornam fibras maduras do cristalino.

Desde o desenvolvimento até o início da idade adulta, a adição de fibras secundárias do cristalino faz com que o cristalino cresça com uma forma mais elipsóide; a partir dos 20 anos, porém, o cristalino fica mais arredondado com o tempo e a íris é muito importante para esse desenvolvimento. Várias proteínas controlam o desenvolvimento embrionário do cristalino: entre elas, principalmente, o PAX6, considerado o gene regulador mestre desse órgão.

Outros efetores do desenvolvimento adequado da lente incluem os componentes de sinalização Wnt BCL9 e Pygo2.


=== Variação ===

Em muitos vertebrados aquáticos, a lente é consideravelmente mais espessa, quase esférica, para aumentar a refração. 

Essa diferença compensa o menor ângulo de refração entre a córnea do olho e o meio aquoso, pois possuem índices de refração semelhantes. 

Mesmo entre os animais terrestres, no entanto, o cristalino de primatas como os humanos é incomumente plano. Em répteis e pássaros, o corpo ciliar toca o cristalino com várias almofadas em sua superfície interna, além das fibras zonulares.

Essas almofadas comprimem e liberam a lente para modificar sua forma enquanto focaliza objetos em diferentes distâncias; as fibras zonulares realizam essa função em mamíferos.

Em peixes e anfíbios, a forma do cristalino é fixa e a focagem é conseguida movendo o cristalino para a frente ou para trás dentro do olho. lente.

Este músculo puxa a lente para a frente de sua posição relaxada ao focalizar objetos próximos.

Em teleósteos, por outro lado, um músculo se projeta de uma estrutura vascular no assoalho do olho, chamado processo falciforme, e serve para puxar o cristalino para trás da posição relaxada para focalizar objetos distantes. 

Enquanto os anfíbios movem o cristalino para frente, assim como os peixes cartilaginosos, os músculos envolvidos não são homólogos aos de nenhum tipo de peixe. 

Nas rãs, existem dois músculos, um acima e outro abaixo da lente, enquanto outros anfíbios têm apenas o músculo inferior.

Nos vertebrados mais primitivos, as lampreias e os peixes-bruxa, o cristalino não está preso à superfície externa do globo ocular. 

Não há humor aquoso nesses peixes, e o corpo vítreo simplesmente pressiona a lente contra a superfície da córnea. 

Para focar seus olhos, uma lampreia achata a córnea usando músculos fora do olho e empurra a lente para trás.


== Função ==

=== Hospedagem ===


O cristalino é flexível e sua curvatura é controlada pelos músculos ciliares através das zônulas. 

Ao alterar a curvatura da lente, pode-se focar o olho em objetos a diferentes distâncias dela. 

Esse processo é chamado de acomodação. 

A uma curta distância focal, o músculo ciliar se contrai, as fibras da zônula se soltam e o cristalino engrossa, resultando em uma forma mais arredondada e, portanto, maior poder de refração. 

Mudar o foco para um objeto a uma distância maior requer o relaxamento da lente e, assim, aumentar a distância focal.

O índice de refração da lente humana varia de aproximadamente 1,406 nas camadas centrais até 1,386 nas camadas menos densas da lente. 

Este gradiente de índice aumenta a potência óptica da lente.

Os animais aquáticos devem confiar inteiramente em suas lentes tanto para focar quanto para fornecer quase todo o poder de refração do olho, pois a interface água-córnea não possui uma diferença grande o suficiente nos índices de refração para fornecer um poder de refração significativo. 

Como tal, as lentes dos olhos aquáticos tendem a ser muito mais redondas e mais duras.


=== Cristalinas e transparência ===

As cristalinas são proteínas solúveis em água que compõem mais de 90% da proteína dentro do cristalino. 

Os três principais tipos de cristalinos encontrados no olho humano são α-, β- e γ-cristalinos. 

As cristalinas tendem a formar agregados solúveis e de alto peso molecular que se compactam firmemente nas fibras da lente, aumentando assim o índice de refração da lente, mantendo sua transparência. Cristalinas β e γ são encontradas principalmente no cristalino, enquanto subunidades de α-cristalina foram isoladas de outras partes do olho e do corpo. As proteínas α-cristalinas pertencem a uma superfamília maior de proteínas moleculares chaperonas e, portanto, acredita-se que as proteínas cristalinas foram recrutadas evolutivamente a partir de proteínas chaperonas para fins ópticos.

As funções de acompanhante da α-cristalina também podem ajudar a manter as proteínas do cristalino, que devem durar a vida inteira de um ser humano.

Outro fator importante na manutenção da transparência do cristalino é a ausência de organelas espalhadoras de luz, como o núcleo, o retículo endoplasmático e as mitocôndrias dentro das fibras maduras do cristalino. 

As fibras do cristalino também possuem um citoesqueleto muito extenso que mantém a forma e o empacotamento precisos das fibras do cristalino; rupturas/mutações em certos elementos do citoesqueleto podem levar à perda de transparência.

A lente bloqueia a maior parte da luz ultravioleta na faixa de comprimento de onda de 300 a 400 nm; comprimentos de onda mais curtos são bloqueados pela córnea.

O pigmento responsável por bloquear a luz é o glicosídeo 3-hidroxiquinurenina, um produto do catabolismo do triptofano no epitélio do cristalino. 

A luz ultravioleta de alta intensidade pode prejudicar a retina e, portanto, as lentes intraoculares artificiais são fabricadas para bloquear também a luz ultravioleta. 

Pessoas sem lentes (uma condição conhecida como afacia) percebem a luz ultravioleta como azul esbranquiçado ou violeta esbranquiçado.


=== Nutrição ===

O cristalino é metabolicamente ativo e requer nutrição para manter seu crescimento e transparência.

Em comparação com outros tecidos do olho, no entanto, o cristalino tem demandas de energia consideravelmente menores. Com nove semanas de desenvolvimento humano, o cristalino é cercado e nutrido por uma rede de vasos, a túnica vasculosa lentis, que é derivada da artéria hialóide.

A partir do quarto mês de desenvolvimento, a artéria hialóide e sua vasculatura relacionada começam a atrofiar e desaparecem completamente ao nascimento.

No olho pós-natal, o canal de Cloquet marca a antiga localização da artéria hialóide.
Após a regressão da artéria hialóide, o cristalino recebe toda a sua nutrição do humor aquoso.

Os nutrientes se difundem e os resíduos se difundem através de um fluxo constante de fluido dos pólos anterior/posterior do cristalino e para fora das regiões equatoriais, uma dinâmica que é mantida pelas bombas Na+/K+-ATPase localizadas nas células equatorialmente posicionadas do cristalino. epitélio da lente. A glicose é a fonte de energia primária para a lente. 

Como as fibras do cristalino maduro não possuem mitocôndrias, aproximadamente 80% da glicose é metabolizada via metabolismo anaeróbico. 

A fração restante de glicose é desviada principalmente pela via das pentoses fosfato. 

A falta de respiração aeróbica significa que a lente também consome muito pouco oxigênio.


== Significado clínico ==

As cataratas são opacidades do cristalino. 

Enquanto alguns são pequenos e não requerem nenhum tratamento, outros podem ser grandes o suficiente para bloquear a luz e obstruir a visão. 

A catarata geralmente se desenvolve à medida que o cristalino envelhecido se torna cada vez mais opaco, mas a catarata também pode se formar de forma congênita ou após lesão no cristalino.

A esclerose nuclear é um tipo de catarata relacionada à idade.

Diabetes é outro fator de risco para catarata.

A cirurgia de catarata envolve a remoção do cristalino e a inserção de uma lente intraocular artificial.

A presbiopia é a perda de acomodação relacionada à idade, que é marcada pela incapacidade do olho de focalizar objetos próximos.

O mecanismo exato ainda é desconhecido, mas as mudanças relacionadas à idade na dureza, forma e tamanho da lente têm sido associadas à condição.

Ectopia lentis é o deslocamento da lente de sua posição normal.

Afacia é a ausência da lente do olho.

A afacia pode ser o resultado de uma cirurgia ou lesão, ou pode ser congênita.
