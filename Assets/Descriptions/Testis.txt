TESTIS/
TESTICLE


Testicle or testis (plural testes) is the male reproductive gland or gonad in all animals, including humans. 

It is homologous to the female ovary. 

The functions of the testes are to produce both sperm and androgens, primarily testosterone. 

Testosterone release is controlled by the anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone, whereas sperm production is controlled both by the anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and gonadal testosterone.


== Structure ==

=== Appearance ===

Males have two testicles of similar size contained within the scrotum, which is an extension of the abdominal wall. 

Scrotal asymmetry is not unusual: one testicle extends farther down into the scrotum than the other due to differences in the anatomy of the vasculature.


=== Measurement ===

The volume of the testicle can be estimated by palpating it and comparing it to ellipsoids of known sizes. 

Another method is to use calipers (an orchidometer) or a ruler either on the person or on an ultrasound image to obtain the three measurements of the x, y, and z axes (length, depth and width). 

These measurements can then be used to calculate the volume, using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid: 

An average adult testicle measures up to 5 cm × 2 cm × 3 cm (2 in × 3⁄4 in × 1+1⁄4 in). 

The Tanner scale for the maturity of male genitals assigns a maturity stage to the calculated volume ranging from stage I, a volume of less than 1.5 cm3; to stage V, a volume greater than 20 cm3. 

Normal volume is 15 to 25 cm3; the average is 18 cm3 per testis (range 12–30 cm3).


=== Internal structure ===

==== Duct system ====

The testes are covered by a tough membranous shell called the tunica albuginea. 

Within the testes are very fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. 

The tubules are lined with a layer of cells (germ cells) that develop from puberty through old age into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes). 

The developing sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the epididymis where newly created sperm cells mature (see spermatogenesis). 

The sperm move into the vas deferens, and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the urethral orifice through muscular contractions.


==== Primary cell types ====

Within the seminiferous tubules, the germ cells develop into spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoon through the process of spermatogenesis. 

The gametes contain DNA for fertilization of an ovum Sertoli cells – the true epithelium of the seminiferous epithelium, critical for the support of germ cell development into spermatozoa. 

Sertoli cells secrete inhibin. 

Peritubular myoid cells surround the seminiferous tubules.Between tubules (interstitial cells), exist Leydig cells – cells localized between seminiferous tubules that produce and secrete testosterone and other androgens important for sexual development and puberty, secondary sexual characteristics like facial hair, sexual behavior and libido. 

They also support spermatogenesis and erectile function. 

Testosterone controls testicular volume. 
Immature Leydig cells and interstitial macrophages and epithelial cells are also present.


==== Blood supply and lymphatic drainage ====

Blood supply and lymphatic drainage of the testes and scrotum are distinct:

The paired testicular arteries arise directly from the abdominal aorta and descend through the inguinal canal, while the scrotum and the rest of the external genitalia is supplied by the internal pudendal artery (itself a branch of the internal iliac artery).

The testis has collateral blood supply from 
1. the cremasteric artery (a branch of the inferior epigastric artery, which is a branch of the external iliac artery), 
and 
2. the artery to the ductus deferens (a branch of the inferior vesical artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery). 

Therefore, if the testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood supplies.

Lymphatic drainage of the testes follows the testicular arteries back to the paraaortic lymph nodes, while lymph from the scrotum drains to the inguinal lymph nodes.


==== Layers ====

Many anatomical features of the adult testis reflect its developmental origin in the abdomen. 

The layers of tissue enclosing each testicle are derived from the layers of the anterior abdominal wall. 

Notably, the cremasteric muscle arises from the internal oblique muscle.


==== The blood–testis barrier ====

Large molecules cannot pass from the blood into the lumen of a seminiferous tubule due to the presence of tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells. 

The spermatogonia are in the basal compartment (deep to the level of the tight junctions) and the more mature forms such as primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids are in the adluminal compartment.

The function of the blood–testis barrier may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction. 

Mature sperm (and their antigens) arise long after immune tolerance is established in infancy. 

Since sperm are antigenically different from self tissue, a male animal can react immunologically to his own sperm. 

He is capable of making antibodies against them.

Injection of sperm antigens causes inflammation of the testis (auto-immune orchitis) and reduced fertility. 

The blood–testis barrier may reduce the likelihood that sperm proteins will induce an immune response, reducing fertility and so progeny.


=== Temperature regulation ===

Spermatogenesis is enhanced at temperatures slightly less than core body temperature. 

The spermatogenesis is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures than 33 °C. 

Because the testes are located outside the body, the smooth tissue of the scrotum can move them closer or further away from the body. 

The temperature of the testes is maintained at 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), i.e. two degrees below the body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 

Higher temperatures affect spermatogenesis. 

There are a number of mechanisms to maintain the testes at the optimum temperature.

The cremasteric muscle is part of the spermatic cord. 

When this muscle contracts, the cord is shortened and the testicle is moved closer up toward the body, which provides slightly more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature. 

When cooling is required, the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the testicle is lowered away from the warm body and is able to cool. 

Contraction also occurs in response to stress (the testicles rise up toward the body in an effort to protect them in a fight).

The cremaster muscle can reflexively raise each testicle individually if properly triggered. 

This phenomenon is known as the cremasteric reflex. 

The testicles can also be lifted voluntarily using the pubococcygeus muscle, which partially activates related muscles.


=== Gene and protein expression ===


The human genome includes approximately 20,000 protein coding genes: 80% of these genes are expressed in adult testes. 

The testes have the highest fraction of tissue type-specific genes compared to other organs and tissues: about 1000 of them are highly specific for the testes, and about 2,200 show an elevated pattern of expression here. 

A majority of these genes encode for proteins that are expressed in the seminiferous tubules and have functions related to spermatogenesis. 

Sperm cells express proteins that result in the development of flagella; these same proteins are expressed in the female in cells lining the fallopian tube, and cause the development of cilia. 

In other words, sperm cell flagella and Fallopian tube cilia are homologous structures. 

The testis-specific proteins that show the highest level of expression are protamines.


== Development ==

There are two phases in which the testes grow substantially; namely in embryonic and pubertal age.


=== Embryonic ===


During mammalian development, the gonads are at first capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. 

In humans, starting at about week 4 the gonadal rudiments are present within the intermediate mesoderm adjacent to the developing kidneys. 

At about week 6, sex cords develop within the forming testes. 

These are made up of early Sertoli cells that surround and nurture the germ cells that migrate into the gonads shortly before sex determination begins. 

In males, the sex-specific gene SRY that is found on the Y-chromosome initiates sex determination by downstream regulation of sex-determining factors, (such as GATA4, SOX9 and AMH), which leads to development of the male phenotype, including directing development of the early bipotential gonad down the male path of development.

Testes follow the "path of descent" from high in the posterior fetal abdomen to the inguinal ring and beyond to the inguinal canal and into the scrotum. 

In most cases (97% full-term, 70% preterm), both testes have descended by birth. 

In most other cases, only one testis fails to descend (cryptorchidism) and that will probably express itself within a year.


=== Pubertal ===

The testes grow in response to the start of spermatogenesis. 

Size depends on lytic function, sperm production (amount of spermatogenesis present in testis), interstitial fluid, and Sertoli cell fluid production. 

After puberty, the volume of the testes can be increased by over 500% as compared to the pre-pubertal size. 

Testicles are fully descended before one reaches puberty.


== Clinical significance ==

=== Protection and injury ===


The testicles are well known to be very sensitive to impact and injury. 

The pain involved travels up from each testicle into the abdominal cavity, via the spermatic plexus, which is the primary nerve of each testicle. 

This will cause pain in the hip and the back. 
The pain usually goes away in a few minutes.

Testicular torsion is a medical emergency.

Testicular rupture is a medical emergency caused by blunt force impact, sharp edge, or piercing impact to one or both testicles, which can lead to necrosis of the testis in as little as 30 minutes.

Penetrating injuries to the scrotum may cause castration, or physical separation or destruction of the testes, possibly along with part or all of the penis, which results in total sterility if the testicles are not reattached quickly.

Some jockstraps are designed to provide support to the testicles.


=== Diseases and conditions ===

-Testicular cancer and other neoplasms – 

To improve the chances of catching possible cases of testicular cancer or other health issues early, regular testicular self-examination is recommended.

-Varicocele, swollen vein(s) from the testes, usually affecting the left side, the testis usually being normal.

-Hydrocele testis, swelling around testes caused by accumulation of clear liquid within a membranous sac, the testis usually being normal

-Spermatocele, a retention cyst of a tubule of the rete testis or the head of the epididymis distended with barely watery fluid that contains spermatozoa.

-Endocrine disorders can also affect the size and function of the testis.

-Certain inherited conditions involving mutations in key developmental genes also impair testicular descent, resulting in abdominal or inguinal testes which remain nonfunctional and may become cancerous. 

-Other genetic conditions can result in the loss of the Wolffian ducts and allow for the persistence of Müllerian ducts. 

-Both excess and deficient levels of estrogens can disrupt spermatogenesis and cause infertility.

-Bell-clapper deformity is a deformity in which the testicle is not attached to the scrotal walls, and can rotate freely on the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis. 

It is the most common underlying cause of testicular torsion.

-Orchitis inflammation of the testicles
-Epididymitis, a painful inflammation of the epididymis or epididymides frequently caused by bacterial infection but sometimes of unknown origin.
-Anorchia, the absence of one or both testicles.
-Cryptorchidism or "undescended testicles", when the testicle does not descend into the scrotum of the infant boy.
-Testicular enlargement is an unspecific sign of various testicular diseases, and can be defined as a testicular size of more than 5 cm (long axis) × 3 cm (short axis).
-Blue balls is a slang term for a temporary fluid congestion in the testicles and prostate region caused by prolonged sexual arousal.
-Testicular prostheses are available to mimic the appearance and feel of one or both testicles, when absent as from injury or as treatment in association to gender dysphoria. 

There have also been some instances of their implantation in dogs.


=== Effects of exogenous hormones ===

To some extent, it is possible to change testicular size. 

Short of direct injury or subjecting them to adverse conditions, e.g., higher temperature than they are normally accustomed to, they can be shrunk by competing against their intrinsic hormonal function through the use of externally administered steroidal hormones. 

Steroids taken for muscle enhancement (especially anabolic steroids) often have the undesired side effect of testicular shrinkage.

Similarly, stimulation of testicular functions via gonadotropic-like hormones may enlarge their size. 

Testes may shrink or atrophy during hormone replacement therapy or through chemical castration.

In all cases, the loss in testes volume corresponds with a loss of spermatogenesis.


== Society and culture ==


The testicles of calves, lambs, roosters, turkeys, and other animals are eaten in many parts of the world, often under euphemistic culinary names. 

Testicles are a by-product of the castration of young animals raised for meat, so they were probably a late-spring seasonal specialty, though nowadays they are generally frozen and available year-round.

As early as 330 BC, Aristotle prescribed the ligation (tying off) of the left testicle in men wishing to have boys. 

In the Middle Ages, men who wanted a boy sometimes had their left testicle removed. 

This was because people believed that the right testicle made "boy" sperm and the left made "girl" sperm.


== Etymology and slang ==

One theory about the etymology of the word testis is based on Roman law. 

The original Latin word testis, "witness", was used in the firmly established legal principle "Testis unus, testis nullus" (one witness [equals] no witness), meaning that testimony by any one person in court was to be disregarded unless corroborated by the testimony of at least another. 

This led to the common practice of producing two witnesses, bribed to testify the same way in cases of lawsuits with ulterior motives. 

Since such "witnesses" always came in pairs, the meaning was accordingly extended, often in the diminutive (testiculus, testiculi).

Another theory says that testis is influenced by a loan translation, from Greek parastatēs "defender (in law), supporter" that is "two glands side by side".In slang, the testes are usually referred to as "balls" as a reference to blue balls. 

Frequently, "nuts" (sometimes intentionally misspelled as "nutz") are also a slang term for the testes due to the geometric resemblance, as evidenced by the various usages of the term "Deez Nuts", which include a satirical political candidate in 2016.


== Other animals ==

=== External appearance ===

In sharks, the testicle on the right side is usually larger, and in many bird and mammal species, the left may be the larger. 

The primitive jawless fish have only a single testis, located in the midline of the body, although even this forms from the fusion of paired structures in the embryo.

In seasonal breeders, the weight of the testes often increases during the breeding season. 

The testicles of a dromedary camel are 7–10 cm (2.8–3.9 in) long, 4.5 cm (1.8 in) deep and 5 cm (2.0 in) in width. 

The right testicle is often smaller than the left.


=== Location ===

==== Internal ====

The basal condition for mammals is to have internal testes. 

The testes of monotremes, xenarthrans, and elephants remain within the abdomen. 

There are also some marsupials with external testes and Boreoeutherian mammals with internal testes, such as the rhinoceros. 

Cetaceans such as whales and dolphins also have internal testes. 

As external testes would increase drag in the water they have internal testes which are kept cool by special circulatory systems that cool the arterial blood going to the testes by placing the arteries near veins bringing cooled venous blood from the skin. 

In odobenids and phocids, the location of the testes is para-abdominal, though otariids have scrotal testes.


==== External ====

Boreoeutherian land mammals, the large group of mammals that includes humans, have externalized testes. 

Their testes function best at temperatures lower than their core body temperature. 

Their testes are located outside of the body, suspended by the spermatic cord within the scrotum.

There are several hypotheses why most boreotherian mammals have external testes which operate best at a temperature that is slightly less than the core body temperature, e.g. that it is stuck with enzymes evolved in a colder temperature due to external testes evolving for different reasons, that the lower temperature of the testes simply is more efficient for sperm production.

    1) More efficient. 

The classic hypothesis is that cooler temperature of the testes allows for more efficient fertile spermatogenesis. 

In other words, there are no possible enzymes operating at normal core body temperature that are as efficient as the ones evolved, at least none appearing in our evolution so far.

The early mammals had lower body temperatures and thus their testes worked efficiently within their body. 

However it is argued that boreotherian mammals have higher body temperatures than the other mammals and had to develop external testes to keep them cool. 

It is argued that those mammals with internal testes, such as the monotremes, armadillos, sloths, elephants, and rhinoceroses, have a lower core body temperatures than those mammals with external testes.

However, the question remains why birds despite having very high core body temperatures have internal testes and did not evolve external testes. 

It was once theorized that birds used their air sacs to cool the testes internally, but later studies revealed that birds' testes are able to function at core body temperature.

Some mammals which have seasonal breeding cycles keep their testes internal until the breeding season at which point their testes descend and increase in size and become external.

    2) Irreversible adaptation to sperm competition. 

It has been suggested that the ancestor of the boreoeutherian mammals was a small mammal that required very large testes (perhaps rather like those of a hamster) for sperm competition and thus had to place its testes outside the body. 

This led to enzymes involved in spermatogenesis, spermatogenic DNA polymerase beta and recombinase activities evolving a unique temperature optimum, slightly less than core body temperature. 

When the boreoeutherian mammals then diversified into forms that were larger and/or did not require intense sperm competition they still produced enzymes that operated best at cooler temperatures and had to keep their testes outside the body. 

This position is made less parsimonious by the fact that the kangaroo, a non-boreoeutherian mammal, has external testicles. 

The ancestors of kangaroos might, separately from boreotherian mammals, have also been subject to heavy sperm competition and thus developed external testes, however, kangaroo external testes are suggestive of a possible adaptive function for external testes in large animals.

    3) Protection from abdominal cavity pressure changes. 

One argument for the evolution of external testes is that it protects the testes from abdominal cavity pressure changes caused by jumping and galloping.

    4) Protection against DNA damage. 

Mild, transient scrotal heat stress causes DNA damage, reduced fertility and abnormal embryonic development in mice. 

DNA strand breaks were found in spermatocytes recovered from testicles subjected to 40 °C or 42 °C for 30 minutes. 

These findings suggest that the external location of the testicles provides the adaptive benefit of protecting spermatogenic cells from heat-induced DNA damage that could otherwise lead to infertility and germline mutation.


=== Size ===

The relative size of testes is often influenced by mating systems. 

Testicular size as a proportion of body weight varies widely. 

In the mammalian kingdom, there is a tendency for testicular size to correspond with multiple mates (e.g., harems, polygamy). 

Production of testicular output sperm and spermatic fluid is also larger in polygamous animals, possibly a spermatogenic competition for survival. 

The testes of the right whale are likely to be the largest of any animal, each weighing around 500 kg (1,100 lb).

Among the Hominidae, gorillas have little female promiscuity and sperm competition and the testes are small compared to body weight (0.03%). 

Chimpanzees have high promiscuity and large testes compared to body weight (0.3%). 

Human testicular size falls between these extremes (0.08%).Testis weight also varies in seasonal breeders like red foxes, golden jackals and coyotes.


=== Internal structure ===

Under a tough membranous shell called the tunica albuginea, the testis of amniotes, as well as some teleost fish, contains very fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules.

Amphibians and most fish do not possess seminiferous tubules. 

Instead, the sperm are produced in spherical structures called sperm ampullae. 

These are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. 

Before the next breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen. 

The ampullae are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates, including the same range of cell types.

TESTÍCULOS/
TESTÍCULO


Testículo o testículo (testículos en plural) es la glándula reproductiva masculina o gónada en todos los animales, incluidos los humanos. 

Es homólogo al ovario femenino. 

Las funciones de los testículos son producir tanto espermatozoides como andrógenos, principalmente testosterona. 

La liberación de testosterona está controlada por la hormona luteinizante de la hipófisis anterior, mientras que la producción de espermatozoides está controlada tanto por la hormona estimulante del folículo de la hipófisis anterior como por la testosterona gonadal.


== Estructura ==

=== Apariencia ===

Los machos tienen dos testículos de tamaño similar contenidos dentro del escroto, que es una extensión de la pared abdominal. 

La asimetría escrotal no es inusual: un testículo se extiende más adentro del escroto que el otro debido a las diferencias en la anatomía de la vasculatura.


=== Medida ===

El volumen del testículo se puede estimar palpándolo y comparándolo con elipsoides de tamaños conocidos. 

Otro método es usar calibradores (un orquidómetro) o una regla ya sea en la persona o en una imagen de ultrasonido para obtener las tres medidas de los ejes x, y y z (longitud, profundidad y ancho).

Estas medidas se pueden usar para calcular el volumen, usando la fórmula para el volumen de un elipsoide:

Un testículo adulto promedio mide hasta 5 cm × 2 cm × 3 cm (2 pulgadas × 3⁄4 pulgadas × 1+1⁄4 pulgadas).

La escala de Tanner para la madurez de los genitales masculinos asigna una etapa de madurez al volumen calculado que va desde la etapa I, un volumen de menos de 1,5 cm3; al estadio V, un volumen superior a 20 cm3.

El volumen normal es de 15 a 25 cm3; el promedio es de 18 cm3 por testículo (rango 12-30 cm3).


=== Estructura interna ===

==== Sistema de conductos ====

Los testículos están cubiertos por una capa membranosa resistente llamada túnica albugínea.

Dentro de los testículos hay tubos enrollados muy finos llamados túbulos seminíferos. 

Los túbulos están revestidos con una capa de células (células germinales) que se desarrollan desde la pubertad hasta la vejez hasta convertirse en espermatozoides (también conocidos como espermatozoides o gametos masculinos). 

Los espermatozoides en desarrollo viajan a través de los túbulos seminíferos a la red testicular ubicada en el mediastino testicular, a los conductos eferentes y luego al epidídimo donde maduran los espermatozoides recién creados (ver espermatogénesis). 

Los espermatozoides se mueven hacia los conductos deferentes y finalmente son expulsados ​​​​a través de la uretra y fuera del orificio uretral a través de contracciones musculares.


==== Tipos de células primarias ====

Dentro de los túbulos seminíferos, las células germinales se convierten en espermatogonias, espermatocitos, espermátides y espermatozoides a través del proceso de espermatogénesis. 

Los gametos contienen ADN para la fertilización de un óvulo Células de Sertoli, el verdadero epitelio del epitelio seminífero, crítico para el apoyo del desarrollo de células germinales en espermatozoides.

Las células de Sertoli secretan inhibina.

Las células mioides peritubulares rodean los túbulos seminíferos. Entre los túbulos (células intersticiales), existen células de Leydig, células localizadas entre los túbulos seminíferos que producen y secretan testosterona y otros andrógenos importantes para el desarrollo sexual y la pubertad, características sexuales secundarias como el vello facial, el comportamiento sexual y la libido. .

También apoyan la espermatogénesis y la función eréctil.

La testosterona controla el volumen testicular.
También están presentes células de Leydig inmaduras y macrófagos intersticiales y células epiteliales.


==== Suministro de sangre y drenaje linfático ====

El suministro de sangre y el drenaje linfático de los testículos y el escroto son distintos:

Las arterias testiculares emparejadas surgen directamente de la aorta abdominal y descienden a través del canal inguinal, mientras que el escroto y el resto de los genitales externos están irrigados por la arteria pudenda interna (en sí misma una rama de la arteria ilíaca interna).

El testículo tiene riego sanguíneo colateral de 
1. la arteria cremastérica (una rama de la arteria epigástrica inferior, que es una rama de la arteria ilíaca externa), 
y 
2. la arteria del conducto deferente (una rama de la arteria vesical inferior, que es una rama de la arteria ilíaca interna). 

Por lo tanto, si se liga la arteria testicular, por ejemplo, durante una orquidopexia de Fowler-Stevens para un testículo alto no descendido, el testículo generalmente sobrevivirá con estos otros suministros de sangre.

El drenaje linfático de los testículos sigue las arterias testiculares de regreso a los ganglios linfáticos paraaórticos, mientras que la linfa del escroto drena a los ganglios linfáticos inguinales.


==== Capas ====

Muchas características anatómicas de los testículos adultos reflejan su origen de desarrollo en el abdomen.

Las capas de tejido que envuelven cada testículo se derivan de las capas de la pared abdominal anterior.

En particular, el músculo cremastérico surge del músculo oblicuo interno.


==== La barrera hematotesticular ====

Las moléculas grandes no pueden pasar de la sangre a la luz de un túbulo seminífero debido a la presencia de uniones estrechas entre las células de Sertoli adyacentes.

Las espermatogonias se encuentran en el compartimento basal (profundo al nivel de las uniones estrechas) y las formas más maduras, como los espermatocitos primarios y secundarios y las espermátides, se encuentran en el compartimento adluminal.

La función de la barrera hematotesticular puede ser prevenir una reacción autoinmune. 

Los espermatozoides maduros (y sus antígenos) surgen mucho después de que se establezca la tolerancia inmunológica en la infancia. 

Dado que los espermatozoides son antigénicamente diferentes del propio tejido, un animal macho puede reaccionar inmunológicamente a su propio esperma. 

Es capaz de fabricar anticuerpos contra ellos.

La inyección de antígenos espermáticos provoca inflamación de los testículos (orquitis autoinmune) y reducción de la fertilidad. 

La barrera hematotesticular puede reducir la probabilidad de que las proteínas del esperma induzcan una respuesta inmunitaria, reduciendo la fertilidad y, por lo tanto, la descendencia.


=== Regulación de temperatura ===

La espermatogénesis aumenta a temperaturas ligeramente inferiores a la temperatura corporal central. 

La espermatogénesis es menos eficiente a temperaturas inferiores y superiores a 33 °C. 

Debido a que los testículos están ubicados fuera del cuerpo, el tejido liso del escroto puede acercarlos o alejarlos del cuerpo. 

La temperatura de los testículos se mantiene a 35 grados Celsius (95 grados Fahrenheit), es decir, dos grados por debajo de la temperatura corporal de 37 grados Celsius (98,6 grados Fahrenheit). 

Las temperaturas más altas afectan la espermatogénesis. 

Hay una serie de mecanismos para mantener los testículos a la temperatura óptima.

El músculo cremastérico forma parte del cordón espermático. 

Cuando este músculo se contrae, el cordón se acorta y el testículo se mueve más cerca del cuerpo, lo que proporciona un poco más de calor para mantener una temperatura testicular óptima. 

Cuando se requiere enfriamiento, el músculo cremastérico se relaja y el testículo se aleja del cuerpo tibio y puede enfriarse. 

La contracción también ocurre en respuesta al estrés (los testículos se elevan hacia el cuerpo en un esfuerzo por protegerlos en una pelea).

El músculo cremaster puede levantar reflexivamente cada testículo individualmente si se activa correctamente.

Este fenómeno se conoce como reflejo cremastérico.

Los testículos también se pueden levantar voluntariamente usando el músculo pubococcígeo, que activa parcialmente los músculos relacionados.


=== Expresión de genes y proteínas ===


El genoma humano incluye aproximadamente 20.000 genes que codifican proteínas: el 80% de estos genes se expresan en testículos adultos.

Los testículos tienen la fracción más alta de genes específicos del tipo de tejido en comparación con otros órganos y tejidos: alrededor de 1000 de ellos son altamente específicos para los testículos y alrededor de 2200 muestran un patrón elevado de expresión aquí.

La mayoría de estos genes codifican proteínas que se expresan en los túbulos seminíferos y tienen funciones relacionadas con la espermatogénesis.

Los espermatozoides expresan proteínas que dan como resultado el desarrollo de flagelos; estas mismas proteínas se expresan en la mujer en las células que recubren la trompa de Falopio y provocan el desarrollo de los cilios.

En otras palabras, los flagelos de los espermatozoides y los cilios de las trompas de Falopio son estructuras homólogas.

Las proteínas testiculares específicas que muestran el mayor nivel de expresión son las protaminas.


== Desarrollo ==

Hay dos fases en las que los testículos crecen sustancialmente; es decir, en la edad embrionaria y puberal.


=== Embrionario ===


Durante el desarrollo de los mamíferos, las gónadas son al principio capaces de convertirse en ovarios o testículos.

En los seres humanos, aproximadamente a partir de la semana 4, los rudimentos gonadales están presentes en el mesodermo intermedio adyacente a los riñones en desarrollo.

Alrededor de la semana 6, los cordones sexuales se desarrollan dentro de los testículos en formación.

Estos están formados por células de Sertoli tempranas que rodean y nutren las células germinales que migran hacia las gónadas poco antes de que comience la determinación del sexo.

En los hombres, el gen SRY específico del sexo que se encuentra en el cromosoma Y inicia la determinación del sexo mediante la regulación posterior de los factores determinantes del sexo (como GATA4, SOX9 y AMH), lo que conduce al desarrollo del fenotipo masculino, incluida la dirección desarrollo de la gónada bipotencial temprana siguiendo el camino masculino de desarrollo.

Los testículos siguen el "camino de descenso" desde la parte superior del abdomen fetal posterior hasta el anillo inguinal y más allá hasta el canal inguinal y el escroto.

En la mayoría de los casos (97 % nacidos a término, 70 % prematuros), ambos testículos han descendido al nacer.

En la mayoría de los demás casos, solo un testículo no desciende (criptorquidia) y eso probablemente se manifestará dentro de un año.


=== Puberal ===

Los testículos crecen en respuesta al inicio de la espermatogénesis.

El tamaño depende de la función lítica, la producción de espermatozoides (cantidad de espermatogénesis presente en los testículos), el líquido intersticial y la producción de líquido de las células de Sertoli.

Después de la pubertad, el volumen de los testículos puede aumentar en más del 500 % en comparación con el tamaño prepuberal.

Los testículos descienden por completo antes de llegar a la pubertad.


== Importancia clínica ==

=== Protección y lesión ===


Los testículos son bien conocidos por ser muy sensibles al impacto y las lesiones.

El dolor involucrado asciende desde cada testículo hacia la cavidad abdominal, a través del plexo espermático, que es el nervio principal de cada testículo.

Esto causará dolor en la cadera y la espalda. 
El dolor generalmente desaparece en unos minutos.

La torsión testicular es una emergencia médica.

La ruptura testicular es una emergencia médica causada por un impacto de fuerza contundente, un borde afilado o un impacto penetrante en uno o ambos testículos, lo que puede provocar necrosis de los testículos en tan solo 30 minutos.

Las lesiones penetrantes en el escroto pueden causar castración, o separación física o destrucción de los testículos, posiblemente junto con parte o la totalidad del pene, lo que resulta en una esterilidad total si los testículos no se vuelven a unir rápidamente.

Algunos suspensorios están diseñados para brindar apoyo a los testículos.


=== Enfermedades y condiciones ===

-Cáncer testicular y otras neoplasias- 

Para mejorar las posibilidades de detectar a tiempo posibles casos de cáncer testicular u otros problemas de salud, se recomienda un autoexamen testicular regular.

-Varicocele, vena(s) hinchada(s) de los testículos, que suele afectar al lado izquierdo, siendo los testículos normalmente normales.

-Hidrocele testicular, hinchazón alrededor de los testículos causada por la acumulación de líquido transparente dentro de un saco membranoso, el testículo suele ser normal

-Espermatocele, quiste de retención de un túbulo de la rete testis o cabeza del epidídimo distendido con líquido apenas acuoso que contiene espermatozoides.

-Los trastornos endocrinos también pueden afectar el tamaño y la función de los testículos.

- Ciertas condiciones hereditarias que involucran mutaciones en genes clave del desarrollo también afectan el descenso testicular, lo que resulta en testículos abdominales o inguinales que no funcionan y pueden volverse cancerosos.

=== Efectos de las hormonas exógenas ===

Hasta cierto punto, es posible cambiar el tamaño testicular.

Salvo que se produzcan lesiones directas o que se sometan a condiciones adversas, por ejemplo, una temperatura más alta de la que normalmente están acostumbrados, pueden encogerse compitiendo contra su función hormonal intrínseca mediante el uso de hormonas esteroides administradas externamente.

Los esteroides que se toman para mejorar los músculos (especialmente los esteroides anabólicos) a menudo tienen el efecto secundario no deseado de encogimiento testicular.

De manera similar, la estimulación de las funciones testiculares a través de hormonas gonadotrópicas puede aumentar su tamaño.

Los testículos pueden encogerse o atrofiarse durante la terapia de reemplazo hormonal o mediante la castración química.

En todos los casos, la pérdida de volumen testicular se corresponde con una pérdida de espermatogénesis.


== Sociedad y cultura ==


Los testículos de terneros, corderos, gallos, pavos y otros animales se comen en muchas partes del mundo, a menudo bajo nombres culinarios eufemísticos.

Los testículos son un subproducto de la castración de animales jóvenes criados para carne, por lo que probablemente eran una especialidad de temporada de finales de primavera, aunque hoy en día generalmente se congelan y están disponibles todo el año.

Ya en el año 330 a. C., Aristóteles prescribió la ligadura (amarre) del testículo izquierdo en los hombres que deseaban tener hijos varones.

En la Edad Media, a los hombres que querían un niño a veces se les extirpaba el testículo izquierdo.

Esto se debía a que la gente creía que el testículo derecho producía espermatozoides de "niño" y el izquierdo, espermatozoides de "niña".


== Etimología y jerga ==

Una teoría sobre la etimología de la palabra testis se basa en el derecho romano.

La palabra latina original testis, "testigo", se usó en el principio legal firmemente establecido "Testis unus, testis nullus" (un testigo [es igual a] ningún testigo), lo que significa que el testimonio de cualquier persona en el tribunal no se debe tener en cuenta a menos que se corrobore. por el testimonio de al menos otro.

Esto condujo a la práctica común de presentar dos testigos, sobornados para declarar de la misma manera en casos de juicios con motivos ulteriores. 

Dado que tales "testigos" siempre venían en parejas, el significado se amplió en consecuencia, a menudo en diminutivo (testiculus, testiculi).

Otra teoría dice que los testículos están influenciados por una traducción prestada, del griego parastatēs "defensor (en la ley), partidario" que es "dos glándulas una al lado de la otra". En la jerga, los testículos generalmente se denominan "bolas" como referencia. a bolas azules. 

Con frecuencia, "nuts" (a veces intencionalmente mal escrito como "nutz") también son un término de argot para los testículos debido a la semejanza geométrica, como lo demuestran los diversos usos del término "Deez Nuts", que incluyen un candidato político satírico en 2016. .


== Otros animales ==

=== Apariencia externa ===

En los tiburones, el testículo del lado derecho suele ser más grande, y en muchas especies de aves y mamíferos, el izquierdo puede ser más grande. 

Los primitivos peces sin mandíbula tienen un solo testículo, ubicado en la línea media del cuerpo, aunque incluso este se forma a partir de la fusión de estructuras pareadas en el embrión.

En los reproductores estacionales, el peso de los testículos suele aumentar durante la temporada de reproducción. 

Los testículos de un camello dromedario miden de 7 a 10 cm (2,8 a 3,9 pulgadas) de largo, 4,5 cm (1,8 pulgadas) de profundidad y 5 cm (2,0 pulgadas) de ancho. 

El testículo derecho suele ser más pequeño que el izquierdo.


=== Ubicación ===

==== Interno ====

La condición básica para los mamíferos es tener testículos internos. 

Los testículos de monotremas, xenartros y elefantes permanecen dentro del abdomen. 

También hay algunos marsupiales con testículos externos y mamíferos boreoeuterios con testículos internos, como el rinoceronte. 

Los cetáceos como las ballenas y los delfines también tienen testículos internos.

Como los testículos externos aumentarían la resistencia en el agua, tienen testículos internos que se mantienen frescos mediante sistemas circulatorios especiales que enfrían la sangre arterial que va a los testículos al colocar las arterias cerca de las venas que traen sangre venosa enfriada de la piel.

En odobénidos y fócidos, la ubicación de los testículos es paraabdominal, aunque los otáridos tienen testículos escrotales.


==== Externo ====

Los mamíferos terrestres boreoeuterios, el gran grupo de mamíferos que incluye a los humanos, tienen testículos externalizados.

Sus testículos funcionan mejor a temperaturas inferiores a la temperatura corporal central.

Sus testículos están ubicados fuera del cuerpo, suspendidos por el cordón espermático dentro del escroto.

Hay varias hipótesis de por qué la mayoría de los mamíferos boreotéricos tienen testículos externos que funcionan mejor a una temperatura ligeramente inferior a la temperatura corporal central, por ejemplo, que están atrapados con enzimas que evolucionan a una temperatura más fría debido a que los testículos externos evolucionan por diferentes razones, que el la temperatura más baja de los testículos simplemente es más eficiente para la producción de esperma.

1) Más eficiente.

La hipótesis clásica es que la temperatura más fría de los testículos permite una espermatogénesis fértil más eficiente.

En otras palabras, no hay enzimas posibles que operen a la temperatura corporal central normal que sean tan eficientes como las que evolucionaron, al menos ninguna que haya aparecido en nuestra evolución hasta ahora.

Los primeros mamíferos tenían temperaturas corporales más bajas y, por lo tanto, sus testículos funcionaban de manera eficiente dentro de su cuerpo.

Sin embargo, se argumenta que los mamíferos boreoterios tienen temperaturas corporales más altas que los otros mamíferos y tuvieron que desarrollar testículos externos para mantenerse frescos.

Se argumenta que aquellos mamíferos con testículos internos, como los monotremas, armadillos, perezosos, elefantes y rinocerontes, tienen una temperatura corporal central más baja que aquellos mamíferos con testículos externos.

Sin embargo, la pregunta sigue siendo por qué las aves, a pesar de tener temperaturas corporales centrales muy altas, tienen testículos internos y no desarrollaron testículos externos.

Una vez se teorizó que las aves usaban sus sacos de aire para enfriar los testículos internamente, pero estudios posteriores revelaron que los testículos de las aves pueden funcionar a la temperatura corporal central.

Algunos mamíferos que tienen ciclos de reproducción estacionales mantienen sus testículos internos hasta la temporada de reproducción, momento en el que descienden y aumentan de tamaño y se vuelven externos.

2) Adaptación irreversible a la competencia espermática.

Se ha sugerido que el antepasado de los mamíferos boreoeuterios era un mamífero pequeño que requería testículos muy grandes (quizás como los de un hámster) para competir con el esperma y, por lo tanto, tenía que colocar sus testículos fuera del cuerpo.

Esto llevó a que las enzimas involucradas en la espermatogénesis, la ADN polimerasa beta espermatogénica y las actividades de la recombinasa evolucionaran a una temperatura óptima única, ligeramente inferior a la temperatura corporal central.

Cuando los mamíferos boreoeuterios luego se diversificaron en formas que eran más grandes y/o no requerían una intensa competencia de esperma, todavía producían enzimas que funcionaban mejor a temperaturas más frías y tenían que mantener sus testículos fuera del cuerpo.

Esta posición se vuelve menos parsimoniosa por el hecho de que el canguro, un mamífero no boreoeuterio, tiene testículos externos.

Los antepasados ​​​​de los canguros podrían, por separado de los mamíferos boreotéricos, también haber estado sujetos a una fuerte competencia de esperma y, por lo tanto, desarrollaron testículos externos; sin embargo, los testículos externos de los canguros sugieren una posible función adaptativa para los testículos externos en animales grandes.

3) Protección contra los cambios de presión en la cavidad abdominal.

Un argumento a favor de la evolución de los testículos externos es que protege a los testículos de los cambios de presión en la cavidad abdominal causados ​​por los saltos y el galope.

 4) Protección contra daños en el ADN. 

El estrés por calor escrotal leve y transitorio causa daño en el ADN, reducción de la fertilidad y desarrollo embrionario anormal en ratones. 

Se encontraron roturas de cadenas de ADN en espermatocitos recuperados de testículos sometidos a 40 °C o 42 °C durante 30 minutos. 

Estos hallazgos sugieren que la ubicación externa de los testículos brinda el beneficio adaptativo de proteger a las células espermatogénicas del daño del ADN inducido por el calor que, de lo contrario, podría conducir a la infertilidad y la mutación de la línea germinal.


=== Tamaño ===

El tamaño relativo de los testículos a menudo está influenciado por los sistemas de apareamiento. 

El tamaño testicular como proporción del peso corporal varía ampliamente. 

En el reino de los mamíferos, existe una tendencia a que el tamaño de los testículos se corresponda con parejas múltiples (p. ej., harenes, poligamia). 

La producción de esperma de salida testicular y fluido espermático también es mayor en animales polígamos, posiblemente una competencia espermatogénica por la supervivencia.

Es probable que los testículos de la ballena franca sean los más grandes de cualquier animal, cada uno con un peso de alrededor de 500 kg (1100 lb).

Entre los homínidos, los gorilas tienen poca promiscuidad femenina y competencia espermática y los testículos son pequeños en comparación con el peso corporal (0,03%).

Los chimpancés tienen alta promiscuidad y testículos grandes en comparación con el peso corporal (0,3%).

El tamaño de los testículos humanos cae entre estos extremos (0,08%). El peso de los testículos también varía en reproductores estacionales como zorros rojos, chacales dorados y coyotes.


=== Estructura interna ===

Debajo de un caparazón membranoso resistente llamado túnica albugínea, los testículos de los amniotas, así como algunos peces teleósteos, contienen tubos enrollados muy finos llamados túbulos seminíferos.

Los anfibios y la mayoría de los peces no poseen túbulos seminíferos. 

En cambio, los espermatozoides se producen en estructuras esféricas llamadas ampollas de esperma. 

Estas son estructuras estacionales, que liberan su contenido durante la temporada de reproducción y luego son reabsorbidas por el cuerpo. 

Antes de la próxima temporada de reproducción, comienzan a formarse y madurar nuevas ampollas de esperma. 

Por lo demás, las ampollas son esencialmente idénticas a los túbulos seminíferos de los vertebrados superiores, e incluyen la misma gama de tipos de células.

TESTICULE/
TESTICULE


Testicule ou testicule (pluriel des testicules) est la glande reproductrice mâle ou la gonade chez tous les animaux, y compris les humains.

Il est homologue de l'ovaire féminin.

Les fonctions des testicules sont de produire à la fois du sperme et des androgènes, principalement de la testostérone.

La libération de testostérone est contrôlée par l'hormone lutéinisante de l'hypophyse antérieure, tandis que la production de sperme est contrôlée à la fois par l'hormone folliculo-stimulante de l'hypophyse antérieure et par la testostérone gonadique.


== Structure ==

=== Apparence ===

Les mâles ont deux testicules de taille similaire contenus dans le scrotum, qui est une extension de la paroi abdominale.

L'asymétrie scrotale n'est pas inhabituelle : un testicule s'étend plus bas dans le scrotum que l'autre en raison de différences dans l'anatomie du système vasculaire.


=== Mesure ===

Le volume du testicule peut être estimé en le palpant et en le comparant à des ellipsoïdes de tailles connues.

Une autre méthode consiste à utiliser des pieds à coulisse (un orchidomètre) ou une règle soit sur la personne soit sur une image échographique pour obtenir les trois mesures des axes x, y et z (longueur, profondeur et largeur). 

Ces mesures peuvent ensuite être utilisées pour calculer le volume, en utilisant la formule du volume d'un ellipsoïde : 

Un testicule adulte moyen mesure jusqu'à 5 cm × 2 cm × 3 cm (2 po × 3⁄4 po × 1+1⁄4 po). 

L'échelle de Tanner pour la maturité des organes génitaux masculins attribue un stade de maturité au volume calculé allant du stade I, un volume inférieur à 1,5 cm3 ; au stade V, un volume supérieur à 20 cm3.

Le volume normal est de 15 à 25 cm3 ; la moyenne est de 18 cm3 par testicule (fourchette de 12 à 30 cm3).


=== Structure interne ===

==== Système de conduits ====

Les testicules sont recouverts d'une coquille membraneuse dure appelée tunique albuginée. 

Dans les testicules se trouvent de très fins tubes enroulés appelés tubules séminifères.

Les tubules sont tapissés d'une couche de cellules (cellules germinales) qui se développent de la puberté à la vieillesse en spermatozoïdes (également appelés spermatozoïdes ou gamètes mâles).

Les spermatozoïdes en développement voyagent à travers les tubules séminifères jusqu'au rete testis situé dans le médiastin testiculaire, jusqu'aux canaux efférents, puis jusqu'à l'épididyme où mûrissent les spermatozoïdes nouvellement créés (voir spermatogenèse).

Les spermatozoïdes pénètrent dans le canal déférent et sont finalement expulsés par l'urètre et hors de l'orifice urétral par des contractions musculaires.


==== Types de cellules primaires ====

Dans les tubules séminifères, les cellules germinales se développent en spermatogonies, spermatocytes, spermatides et spermatozoïdes par le processus de spermatogenèse.

Les gamètes contiennent de l'ADN pour la fécondation d'un ovule Cellules de Sertoli - le véritable épithélium de l'épithélium séminifère, essentiel au soutien du développement des cellules germinales en spermatozoïdes. 

Les cellules de Sertoli sécrètent de l'inhibine. 

Les cellules myoïdes péritubulaires entourent les tubules séminifères. Entre les tubules (cellules interstitielles), il existe des cellules de Leydig - des cellules localisées entre les tubules séminifères qui produisent et sécrètent de la testostérone et d'autres androgènes importants pour le développement sexuel et la puberté, des caractéristiques sexuelles secondaires comme les poils du visage, le comportement sexuel et la libido . 

Ils soutiennent également la spermatogenèse et la fonction érectile. 

La testostérone contrôle le volume testiculaire. 
Des cellules de Leydig immatures, des macrophages interstitiels et des cellules épithéliales sont également présents.


==== Apport sanguin et drainage lymphatique ====

La vascularisation et le drainage lymphatique des testicules et du scrotum sont distincts :

Les artères testiculaires appariées proviennent directement de l'aorte abdominale et descendent par le canal inguinal, tandis que le scrotum et le reste des organes génitaux externes sont alimentés par l'artère pudendale interne (elle-même une branche de l'artère iliaque interne).

Le testicule a un apport sanguin collatéral de
1. l'artère crémasterique (une branche de l'artère épigastrique inférieure, qui est une branche de l'artère iliaque externe),
et
2. l'artère du canal déférent (une branche de l'artère vésicale inférieure, qui est une branche de l'artère iliaque interne).

Par conséquent, si l'artère testiculaire est ligaturée, par exemple lors d'une orchiopexie Fowler-Stevens pour un testicule haut non descendu, le testicule survivra généralement grâce à ces autres réserves de sang.

Le drainage lymphatique des testicules suit les artères testiculaires jusqu'aux ganglions lymphatiques paraaortiques, tandis que la lymphe du scrotum se draine vers les ganglions lymphatiques inguinaux.


==== Couches ====

De nombreuses caractéristiques anatomiques du testicule adulte reflètent son origine développementale dans l'abdomen. 

Les couches de tissu entourant chaque testicule sont dérivées des couches de la paroi abdominale antérieure. 

Notamment, le muscle crémasterique provient du muscle oblique interne.


==== La barrière hémato-testiculaire ====

Les grosses molécules ne peuvent pas passer du sang dans la lumière d'un tubule séminifère en raison de la présence de jonctions serrées entre les cellules de Sertoli adjacentes. 

Les spermatogonies sont dans le compartiment basal (profondément au niveau des jonctions serrées) et les formes plus matures telles que les spermatocytes primaires et secondaires et les spermatides sont dans le compartiment adluminal.

La fonction de la barrière hémato-testiculaire peut être de prévenir une réaction auto-immune.

Les spermatozoïdes matures (et leurs antigènes) apparaissent longtemps après l'établissement de la tolérance immunitaire dans la petite enfance.

Étant donné que les spermatozoïdes sont antigéniquement différents des tissus du soi, un animal mâle peut réagir immunologiquement à son propre sperme.

Il est capable de fabriquer des anticorps contre eux.

L'injection d'antigènes spermatiques provoque une inflammation des testicules (orchite auto-immune) et une diminution de la fertilité.

La barrière hémato-testiculaire peut réduire la probabilité que les protéines du sperme induisent une réponse immunitaire, réduisant la fertilité et donc la progéniture.


=== Régulation de température ===

La spermatogenèse est améliorée à des températures légèrement inférieures à la température corporelle centrale.

La spermatogenèse est moins efficace à des températures inférieures et supérieures à 33 °C.

Parce que les testicules sont situés à l'extérieur du corps, le tissu lisse du scrotum peut les rapprocher ou les éloigner du corps. 

La température des testicules est maintenue à 35 degrés Celsius (95 degrés Fahrenheit), soit deux degrés en dessous de la température corporelle de 37 degrés Celsius (98,6 degrés Fahrenheit). 

Des températures plus élevées affectent la spermatogenèse. 

Il existe un certain nombre de mécanismes pour maintenir les testicules à la température optimale.

Le muscle crémasterique fait partie du cordon spermatique. 

Lorsque ce muscle se contracte, le cordon est raccourci et le testicule se rapproche du corps, ce qui fournit un peu plus de chaleur pour maintenir une température testiculaire optimale. 

Lorsqu'un refroidissement est nécessaire, le muscle crémasterique se détend et le testicule est abaissé loin du corps chaud et est capable de se refroidir. 

La contraction se produit également en réponse au stress (les testicules s'élèvent vers le corps dans le but de les protéger lors d'un combat).

Le muscle crémaster peut soulever par réflexe chaque testicule individuellement s'il est correctement déclenché. 

Ce phénomène est connu sous le nom de réflexe crémasterique. 

Les testicules peuvent également être soulevés volontairement à l'aide du muscle pubococcygien, qui active partiellement les muscles associés.


=== Expression génique et protéique ===


Le génome humain comprend environ 20 000 gènes codant pour des protéines : 80 % de ces gènes sont exprimés dans les testicules adultes. 

Les testicules ont la fraction la plus élevée de gènes spécifiques au type de tissu par rapport aux autres organes et tissus : environ 1 000 d'entre eux sont hautement spécifiques pour les testicules, et environ 2 200 présentent ici un schéma d'expression élevé. 

Une majorité de ces gènes codent pour des protéines qui sont exprimées dans les tubules séminifères et ont des fonctions liées à la spermatogenèse. 

Les spermatozoïdes expriment des protéines qui entraînent le développement de flagelles ; ces mêmes protéines sont exprimées chez la femme dans les cellules tapissant la trompe de Fallope et provoquent le développement des cils.

En d'autres termes, les flagelles des spermatozoïdes et les cils des trompes de Fallope sont des structures homologues. 

Les protéines spécifiques aux testicules qui présentent le niveau d'expression le plus élevé sont les protamines.


== Développement ==

Il y a deux phases au cours desquelles les testicules se développent considérablement ; à savoir à l'âge embryonnaire et pubertaire.


=== Embryonnaire ===


Au cours du développement des mammifères, les gonades sont d'abord capables de devenir soit des ovaires, soit des testicules. 

Chez l'homme, à partir d'environ la semaine 4, les rudiments gonadiques sont présents dans le mésoderme intermédiaire adjacent aux reins en développement. 

Vers la semaine 6, les cordons sexuels se développent dans les testicules en formation. 

Celles-ci sont constituées de cellules de Sertoli précoces qui entourent et nourrissent les cellules germinales qui migrent dans les gonades peu de temps avant le début de la détermination du sexe. 

Chez les hommes, le gène spécifique au sexe SRY qui se trouve sur le chromosome Y initie la détermination du sexe par la régulation en aval des facteurs déterminant le sexe (tels que GATA4, SOX9 et AMH), ce qui conduit au développement du phénotype masculin, y compris la direction développement de la gonade bipotentielle précoce le long de la voie de développement masculine.

Les testicules suivent le "chemin de descente" du haut de l'abdomen fœtal postérieur à l'anneau inguinal et au-delà jusqu'au canal inguinal et dans le scrotum. 

Dans la plupart des cas (97 % à terme, 70 % avant terme), les deux testicules sont descendus à la naissance.

Dans la plupart des autres cas, un seul testicule ne parvient pas à descendre (cryptorchidie) et cela s'exprimera probablement d'ici un an.


=== Puberté ===

Les testicules se développent en réponse au début de la spermatogenèse.

La taille dépend de la fonction lytique, de la production de spermatozoïdes (quantité de spermatogenèse présente dans les testicules), du liquide interstitiel et de la production de liquide des cellules de Sertoli.

Après la puberté, le volume des testicules peut être augmenté de plus de 500 % par rapport à la taille pré-pubertaire.

Les testicules sont complètement descendus avant d'atteindre la puberté.


== Signification clinique ==

=== Protection et blessure ===


Les testicules sont bien connus pour être très sensibles aux chocs et aux blessures.

La douleur impliquée remonte de chaque testicule dans la cavité abdominale, via le plexus spermatique, qui est le nerf primaire de chaque testicule. 

Cela provoquera des douleurs dans la hanche et le dos. 
La douleur disparaît généralement en quelques minutes.

La torsion testiculaire est une urgence médicale.

La rupture testiculaire est une urgence médicale causée par un impact contondant, une arête vive ou un impact perçant sur un ou les deux testicules, ce qui peut entraîner une nécrose du testicule en aussi peu que 30 minutes.

Les blessures pénétrantes au scrotum peuvent provoquer la castration, ou la séparation physique ou la destruction des testicules, éventuellement avec une partie ou la totalité du pénis, ce qui entraîne une stérilité totale si les testicules ne sont pas rattachés rapidement.

Certains jockstraps sont conçus pour fournir un soutien aux testicules.


=== Maladies et conditions ===

-Cancer des testicules et autres néoplasmes – 

Pour améliorer les chances de détecter rapidement des cas possibles de cancer des testicules ou d'autres problèmes de santé, un auto-examen régulier des testicules est recommandé.

-Varicocèle, veine(s) enflée(s) des testicules, affectant généralement le côté gauche, les testicules étant généralement normaux.

- Testicule d'hydrocèle, gonflement autour des testicules causé par l'accumulation de liquide clair dans un sac membraneux, le testicule étant généralement normal

-Spermatocèle, un kyste de rétention d'un tubule du rete testis ou de la tête de l'épididyme distendu avec un liquide à peine aqueux qui contient des spermatozoïdes.

-Les troubles endocriniens peuvent également affecter la taille et la fonction des testicules.

-Certaines conditions héréditaires impliquant des mutations dans des gènes clés du développement altèrent également la descente testiculaire, entraînant des testicules abdominaux ou inguinaux qui restent non fonctionnels et peuvent devenir cancéreux.

-D'autres conditions génétiques peuvent entraîner la perte des canaux de Wolff et permettre la persistance des canaux de Müller.

-Les niveaux excessifs et déficients d'œstrogènes peuvent perturber la spermatogenèse et provoquer l'infertilité.

-La déformation en battant de cloche est une déformation dans laquelle le testicule n'est pas attaché aux parois du scrotum et peut tourner librement sur le cordon spermatique à l'intérieur de la tunique vaginale.

C'est la cause sous-jacente la plus fréquente de torsion testiculaire.

-Orchite inflammation des testicules
-L'épididymite, une inflammation douloureuse de l'épididyme ou des épididymes fréquemment causée par une infection bactérienne mais parfois d'origine inconnue.
-Anorchie, l'absence d'un ou des deux testicules.
-Cryptorchidie ou "testicules non descendus", lorsque le testicule ne descend pas dans le scrotum du petit garçon.
- L'hypertrophie testiculaire est un signe non spécifique de diverses maladies testiculaires et peut être définie comme une taille testiculaire de plus de 5 cm (axe long) × 3 cm (axe court).
-Les boules bleues sont un terme d'argot désignant une congestion temporaire des fluides dans les testicules et la région de la prostate causée par une excitation sexuelle prolongée.
-Des prothèses testiculaires sont disponibles pour imiter l'apparence et la sensation d'un ou des deux testicules, en cas d'absence suite à une blessure ou en tant que traitement associé à la dysphorie de genre. 

Il y a aussi eu quelques exemples de leur implantation chez le chien.


=== Effets des hormones exogènes ===

Dans une certaine mesure, il est possible de modifier la taille des testicules. 

À moins de les blesser directement ou de les soumettre à des conditions défavorables, par exemple une température plus élevée que celle à laquelle ils sont normalement habitués, ils peuvent être rétrécis en entrant en compétition avec leur fonction hormonale intrinsèque grâce à l'utilisation d'hormones stéroïdiennes administrées de manière externe. 

Les stéroïdes pris pour l'amélioration musculaire (en particulier les stéroïdes anabolisants) ont souvent l'effet secondaire indésirable du rétrécissement des testicules.

De même, la stimulation des fonctions testiculaires via des hormones de type gonadotrope peut augmenter leur taille. 

Les testicules peuvent rétrécir ou s'atrophier pendant le traitement hormonal substitutif ou par castration chimique.

Dans tous les cas, la perte de volume testiculaire correspond à une perte de spermatogenèse.


== Société et culture ==


Les testicules de veaux, d'agneaux, de coqs, de dindes et d'autres animaux sont consommés dans de nombreuses régions du monde, souvent sous des noms culinaires euphémiques. 

Les testicules sont un sous-produit de la castration des jeunes animaux élevés pour la viande, ils étaient donc probablement une spécialité saisonnière de la fin du printemps, bien qu'aujourd'hui ils soient généralement congelés et disponibles toute l'année.

Dès 330 av. J.-C., Aristote prescrivait la ligature (nouage) du testicule gauche chez les hommes souhaitant avoir des garçons.

Au Moyen Âge, les hommes qui voulaient un garçon se faisaient parfois enlever le testicule gauche.

C'était parce que les gens croyaient que le testicule droit produisait du sperme de "garçon" et que le testicule gauche produisait du sperme de "fille".


== Étymologie et argot ==

Une théorie sur l'étymologie du mot testis est basée sur le droit romain.

Le mot latin original testis, "témoin", a été utilisé dans le principe juridique fermement établi "Testis unus, testis nullus" (un témoin [égal] pas de témoin), ce qui signifie que le témoignage de toute personne devant le tribunal devait être ignoré à moins d'être corroboré par le témoignage d'au moins un autre.

Cela a conduit à la pratique courante de produire deux témoins, soudoyés pour témoigner de la même manière dans les cas de poursuites avec des arrière-pensées.

Comme ces "témoins" venaient toujours par paires, le sens était donc élargi, souvent au diminutif (testiculus, testiculi).

Une autre théorie dit que les testicules sont influencés par une traduction de prêt, du grec parastatēs "défenseur (en droit), supporter" qui est "deux glandes côte à côte". En argot, les testicules sont généralement appelés "boules" comme référence aux boules bleues.

Fréquemment, les «noix» (parfois intentionnellement mal orthographiées comme «nutz») sont également un terme d'argot pour les testicules en raison de la ressemblance géométrique, comme en témoignent les divers usages du terme «Deez Nuts», qui incluent un candidat politique satirique en 2016 .


== Autres animaux ==

=== Aspect extérieur ===

Chez les requins, le testicule du côté droit est généralement plus gros, et chez de nombreuses espèces d'oiseaux et de mammifères, le testicule de gauche peut être le plus gros.

Les poissons primitifs sans mâchoires n'ont qu'un seul testicule, situé dans la ligne médiane du corps, bien que même celui-ci se forme à partir de la fusion de structures appariées dans l'embryon.

Chez les reproducteurs saisonniers, le poids des testicules augmente souvent pendant la saison de reproduction.

Les testicules d'un dromadaire mesurent 7 à 10 cm (2,8 à 3,9 po) de long, 4,5 cm (1,8 po) de profondeur et 5 cm (2,0 po) de largeur.

Le testicule droit est souvent plus petit que le gauche.


=== Emplacement ===

==== Interne ====

La condition de base pour les mammifères est d'avoir des testicules internes.

Les testicules des monotrèmes, des xénarthrans et des éléphants restent dans l'abdomen.

Il existe également des marsupiaux à testicules externes et des mammifères boréoeuthériens à testicules internes, comme le rhinocéros.

Les cétacés tels que les baleines et les dauphins ont également des testicules internes.

Comme les testicules externes augmenteraient la traînée dans l'eau, ils ont des testicules internes qui sont maintenus au frais par des systèmes circulatoires spéciaux qui refroidissent le sang artériel allant aux testicules en plaçant les artères près des veines apportant du sang veineux refroidi de la peau.

Chez les odobénidés et les phocidés, la localisation des testicules est para-abdominale, bien que les otariidés aient des testicules scrotaux.


==== Externe ====

Les mammifères terrestres boréoeuthériens, le grand groupe de mammifères qui comprend les humains, ont des testicules externalisés.

Leurs testicules fonctionnent mieux à des températures inférieures à leur température corporelle centrale.

Leurs testicules sont situés à l'extérieur du corps, suspendus par le cordon spermatique dans le scrotum.

Il existe plusieurs hypothèses expliquant pourquoi la plupart des mammifères boréotheriens ont des testicules externes qui fonctionnent mieux à une température légèrement inférieure à la température corporelle centrale, par exemple qu'ils sont bloqués par des enzymes évoluées à une température plus froide en raison de testicules externes évoluant pour différentes raisons, que le une température plus basse des testicules est simplement plus efficace pour la production de sperme.

1) Plus efficace.

L'hypothèse classique est qu'une température plus froide des testicules permet une spermatogenèse fertile plus efficace.

En d'autres termes, il n'y a pas d'enzymes possibles fonctionnant à une température corporelle centrale normale qui soient aussi efficaces que celles qui ont évolué, du moins aucune n'apparaissant dans notre évolution jusqu'à présent.

Les premiers mammifères avaient des températures corporelles plus basses et leurs testicules fonctionnaient donc efficacement dans leur corps. 

Cependant, on fait valoir que les mammifères boréotheriens ont des températures corporelles plus élevées que les autres mammifères et ont dû développer des testicules externes pour les garder au frais. 

On fait valoir que les mammifères à testicules internes, tels que les monotrèmes, les tatous, les paresseux, les éléphants et les rhinocéros, ont une température corporelle centrale inférieure à celle des mammifères à testicules externes.

Cependant, la question reste de savoir pourquoi les oiseaux, malgré des températures corporelles très élevées, ont des testicules internes et n'ont pas développé de testicules externes. 

Il était autrefois théorisé que les oiseaux utilisaient leurs sacs aériens pour refroidir les testicules de l'intérieur, mais des études ultérieures ont révélé que les testicules des oiseaux sont capables de fonctionner à la température corporelle centrale.

Certains mammifères qui ont des cycles de reproduction saisonniers gardent leurs testicules internes jusqu'à la saison de reproduction, moment auquel leurs testicules descendent et grossissent et deviennent externes.

 2) Adaptation irréversible à la compétition spermatique. 

Il a été suggéré que l'ancêtre des mammifères boréoeuthériens était un petit mammifère qui nécessitait de très gros testicules (peut-être un peu comme ceux d'un hamster) pour la compétition des spermatozoïdes et devait donc placer ses testicules à l'extérieur du corps. 

Cela a conduit à des enzymes impliquées dans la spermatogenèse, l'ADN polymérase spermatogène bêta et les activités de recombinase développant une température optimale unique, légèrement inférieure à la température corporelle centrale. 

Lorsque les mammifères boréoeuthériens se sont ensuite diversifiés dans des formes plus grandes et / ou ne nécessitant pas de compétition intense des spermatozoïdes, ils produisaient toujours des enzymes qui fonctionnaient mieux à des températures plus fraîches et devaient garder leurs testicules à l'extérieur du corps.

Cette position est rendue moins parcimonieuse par le fait que le kangourou, mammifère non boréeuthérien, possède des testicules externes.

Les ancêtres des kangourous pourraient, séparément des mammifères boréotheriens, avoir également été soumis à une forte compétition de sperme et ainsi développer des testicules externes, cependant, les testicules externes de kangourou suggèrent une fonction adaptative possible pour les testicules externes chez les grands animaux.

3) Protection contre les changements de pression dans la cavité abdominale.

Un argument en faveur de l'évolution des testicules externes est qu'il protège les testicules des changements de pression de la cavité abdominale causés par les sauts et les galops.

 4) Protection contre les dommages à l'ADN. 

Un stress thermique scrotal léger et transitoire provoque des dommages à l'ADN, une réduction de la fertilité et un développement embryonnaire anormal chez la souris. 

Des cassures de brins d'ADN ont été trouvées dans des spermatocytes récupérés à partir de testicules soumis à 40 °C ou 42 °C pendant 30 minutes. 

Ces résultats suggèrent que l'emplacement externe des testicules offre l'avantage adaptatif de protéger les cellules spermatogènes contre les dommages à l'ADN induits par la chaleur qui pourraient autrement conduire à l'infertilité et à la mutation germinale.


=== Taille ===

La taille relative des testicules est souvent influencée par les systèmes d'accouplement. 

La taille des testicules en proportion du poids corporel varie considérablement. 

Dans le règne des mammifères, la taille des testicules a tendance à correspondre à plusieurs partenaires (par exemple, harems, polygamie). 

La production de sperme de sortie testiculaire et de liquide spermatique est également plus importante chez les animaux polygames, peut-être une compétition spermatogène pour la survie. 

Les testicules de la baleine noire sont probablement les plus gros de tous les animaux, chacun pesant environ 500 kg (1 100 lb).

Parmi les Hominidae, les gorilles ont peu de promiscuité féminine et de compétition de sperme et les testicules sont petits par rapport au poids corporel (0,03%). 

Les chimpanzés ont une promiscuité élevée et de gros testicules par rapport au poids corporel (0,3%). 

La taille des testicules humains se situe entre ces extrêmes (0,08 %). Le poids des testicules varie également chez les reproducteurs saisonniers comme les renards roux, les chacals dorés et les coyotes.


=== Structure interne ===

Sous une coquille membraneuse dure appelée tunique albuginée, les testicules des amniotes, ainsi que certains poissons téléostéens, contiennent de très fins tubes enroulés appelés tubules séminifères.

Les amphibiens et la plupart des poissons ne possèdent pas de tubules séminifères.

Au lieu de cela, les spermatozoïdes sont produits dans des structures sphériques appelées ampoules à spermatozoïdes.

Ce sont des structures saisonnières, libérant leur contenu pendant la saison de reproduction, puis réabsorbées par l'organisme.

Avant la prochaine saison de reproduction, de nouvelles ampoules de sperme commencent à se former et à mûrir.

Les ampoules sont par ailleurs essentiellement identiques aux tubules séminifères chez les vertébrés supérieurs, y compris la même gamme de types de cellules.

TESTÍCULO/
TESTÍCULO


Testículo ou testículo (testículos plural) é a glândula reprodutiva masculina ou gônada em todos os animais, incluindo humanos. 

É homólogo ao ovário feminino. 

As funções dos testículos são produzir espermatozóides e andrógenos, principalmente testosterona.

A liberação de testosterona é controlada pelo hormônio luteinizante da hipófise anterior, enquanto a produção de espermatozóides é controlada tanto pelo hormônio folículo-estimulante da hipófise anterior quanto pela testosterona gonadal.


== Estrutura ==

=== Aparência ===

Os machos têm dois testículos de tamanho semelhante contidos no escroto, que é uma extensão da parede abdominal.

A assimetria escrotal não é incomum: um testículo se estende mais para dentro do escroto do que o outro devido a diferenças na anatomia da vasculatura.


=== Medida ===

O volume do testículo pode ser estimado palpando-o e comparando-o com elipsóides de tamanhos conhecidos.

Outro método é usar um paquímetro (um orquidômetro) ou uma régua na pessoa ou em uma imagem de ultrassom para obter as três medidas dos eixos x, y e z (comprimento, profundidade e largura).

Essas medidas podem ser usadas para calcular o volume, usando a fórmula para o volume de um elipsóide:

Um testículo adulto médio mede até 5 cm × 2 cm × 3 cm (2 pol × 3⁄4 pol × 1 + 1⁄4 pol).

A escala de Tanner para a maturidade dos genitais masculinos atribui um estágio de maturidade ao volume calculado variando do estágio I, um volume menor que 1,5 cm3; para o estágio V, um volume maior que 20 cm3.

O volume normal é de 15 a 25 cm3; a média é de 18 cm3 por testículo (intervalo de 12–30 cm3).


=== Estrutura interna ===

==== Sistema de dutos ====

Os testículos são cobertos por uma casca membranosa resistente chamada túnica albugínea.

Dentro dos testículos há tubos enrolados muito finos chamados túbulos seminíferos. 

Os túbulos são revestidos com uma camada de células (células germinativas) que se desenvolvem desde a puberdade até a velhice em espermatozóides (também conhecidos como espermatozóides ou gametas masculinos). 

Os espermatozóides em desenvolvimento viajam através dos túbulos seminíferos para a rede testicular localizada no mediastino testicular, para os ductos eferentes e depois para o epidídimo, onde os espermatozóides recém-criados amadurecem (ver espermatogênese). 

Os espermatozoides movem-se para o ducto deferente e são eventualmente expelidos pela uretra e para fora do orifício uretral por meio de contrações musculares.


==== Tipos de células primárias ====

Dentro dos túbulos seminíferos, as células germinativas se desenvolvem em espermatogônias, espermatócitos, espermátides e espermatozóides através do processo de espermatogênese. 

Os gametas contêm DNA para a fertilização de um óvulo. As células de Sertoli – o verdadeiro epitélio do epitélio seminífero, crítico para o suporte do desenvolvimento de células germinativas em espermatozóides. 

As células de Sertoli secretam inibina. 

As células mióides peritubulares circundam os túbulos seminíferos. Entre os túbulos (células intersticiais), existem células de Leydig – células localizadas entre os túbulos seminíferos que produzem e secretam testosterona e outros andrógenos importantes para o desenvolvimento sexual e puberdade, características sexuais secundárias como pêlos faciais, comportamento sexual e libido . 

Eles também suportam a espermatogênese e a função erétil. 

A testosterona controla o volume testicular. 
Células de Leydig imaturas e macrófagos intersticiais e células epiteliais também estão presentes.


==== Suprimento sanguíneo e drenagem linfática ====

O suprimento sanguíneo e a drenagem linfática dos testículos e escroto são distintos:

As artérias testiculares pareadas originam-se diretamente da aorta abdominal e descem pelo canal inguinal, enquanto o escroto e o restante da genitália externa são supridos pela artéria pudenda interna (um ramo da artéria ilíaca interna).

O testículo tem suprimento sanguíneo colateral de 
1. a artéria cremastérica (um ramo da artéria epigástrica inferior, que é um ramo da artéria ilíaca externa), 
e 
2. a artéria para o ducto deferente (um ramo da artéria vesical inferior, que é um ramo da artéria ilíaca interna). 

Portanto, se a artéria testicular for ligada, por exemplo, durante uma orquipexia de Fowler-Stevens para um testículo não descido alto, o testículo geralmente sobreviverá com esses outros suprimentos de sangue.

A drenagem linfática dos testículos segue as artérias testiculares de volta aos linfonodos paraaórticos, enquanto a linfa do escroto drena para os linfonodos inguinais.


==== Camadas ====

Muitas características anatômicas do testículo adulto refletem sua origem de desenvolvimento no abdome. 

As camadas de tecido que envolvem cada testículo são derivadas das camadas da parede abdominal anterior. 

Notavelmente, o músculo cremastérico surge do músculo oblíquo interno.


==== A barreira hematotesticular ====

Moléculas grandes não podem passar do sangue para o lúmen de um túbulo seminífero devido à presença de junções apertadas entre as células de Sertoli adjacentes. 

As espermatogônias estão no compartimento basal (profundamente ao nível das junções apertadas) e as formas mais maduras, como espermatócitos e espermátides primários e secundários, estão no compartimento adluminal.

A função da barreira hematotesticular pode ser prevenir uma reação autoimune.

Os espermatozoides maduros (e seus antígenos) surgem muito depois que a tolerância imunológica é estabelecida na infância.

Uma vez que o esperma é antigenicamente diferente do tecido próprio, um animal macho pode reagir imunologicamente ao seu próprio esperma.

Ele é capaz de produzir anticorpos contra eles.

A injeção de antígenos espermáticos causa inflamação do testículo (orquite autoimune) e redução da fertilidade.

A barreira sangue-testículo pode reduzir a probabilidade de que as proteínas do esperma induzam uma resposta imune, reduzindo a fertilidade e, portanto, a progênie.


=== Regulação de temperatura ===

A espermatogênese é aumentada em temperaturas ligeiramente inferiores à temperatura corporal central.

A espermatogênese é menos eficiente em temperaturas mais baixas e mais altas que 33°C.

Como os testículos estão localizados fora do corpo, o tecido liso do escroto pode aproximá-los ou afastá-los do corpo. 

A temperatura dos testículos é mantida a 35 graus Celsius (95 graus Fahrenheit), ou seja, dois graus abaixo da temperatura corporal de 37 graus Celsius (98,6 graus Fahrenheit). 

Temperaturas mais altas afetam a espermatogênese. 

Existem vários mecanismos para manter os testículos na temperatura ideal.

O músculo cremastérico faz parte do cordão espermático. 

Quando esse músculo se contrai, o cordão é encurtado e o testículo é movido para mais perto do corpo, o que fornece um pouco mais de calor para manter a temperatura testicular ideal. 

Quando o resfriamento é necessário, o músculo cremastérico relaxa e o testículo é abaixado para longe do corpo quente e pode esfriar. 

A contração também ocorre em resposta ao estresse (os testículos sobem em direção ao corpo em um esforço para protegê-los em uma luta).

O músculo cremaster pode elevar reflexivamente cada testículo individualmente se acionado corretamente. 

Esse fenômeno é conhecido como reflexo cremastérico. 

Os testículos também podem ser levantados voluntariamente usando o músculo pubococcígeo, que ativa parcialmente os músculos relacionados.


=== Expressão de genes e proteínas ===


O genoma humano inclui aproximadamente 20.000 genes codificadores de proteínas: 80% desses genes são expressos em testículos adultos. 

Os testículos têm a maior fração de genes específicos do tipo de tecido em comparação com outros órgãos e tecidos: cerca de 1.000 deles são altamente específicos para os testículos e cerca de 2.200 mostram um padrão elevado de expressão aqui. 

A maioria desses genes codifica proteínas que são expressas nos túbulos seminíferos e têm funções relacionadas à espermatogênese.

Os espermatozóides expressam proteínas que resultam no desenvolvimento de flagelos; essas mesmas proteínas são expressas na mulher nas células que revestem a trompa de Falópio e causam o desenvolvimento dos cílios.

Em outras palavras, os flagelos dos espermatozoides e os cílios das trompas de Falópio são estruturas homólogas.

As proteínas específicas do testículo que mostram o nível mais alto de expressão são as protaminas.


== Desenvolvimento ==

Existem duas fases nas quais os testículos crescem substancialmente; nomeadamente na idade embrionária e puberal.


=== Embrionário ===


Durante o desenvolvimento dos mamíferos, as gônadas são inicialmente capazes de se tornarem ovários ou testículos.

Em humanos, a partir da 4ª semana, os rudimentos gonadais estão presentes no mesoderma intermediário adjacente aos rins em desenvolvimento. 

Por volta da semana 6, os cordões sexuais se desenvolvem dentro dos testículos em formação. 

Estes são compostos de células de Sertoli primitivas que cercam e nutrem as células germinativas que migram para as gônadas pouco antes do início da determinação do sexo. 

Nos machos, o gene específico do sexo SRY que é encontrado no cromossomo Y inicia a determinação do sexo pela regulação a jusante dos fatores determinantes do sexo (como GATA4, SOX9 e AMH), o que leva ao desenvolvimento do fenótipo masculino, incluindo direcionamento desenvolvimento da gônada bipotencial inicial no caminho do desenvolvimento masculino.

Os testículos seguem o "caminho de descida" do alto do abdome fetal posterior ao anel inguinal e além do canal inguinal e no escroto. 

Na maioria dos casos (97% a termo, 70% prematuros), ambos os testículos desceram ao nascimento.

Na maioria dos outros casos, apenas um testículo não desce (criptorquidia) e isso provavelmente se manifestará dentro de um ano.


=== Puberal ===

Os testículos crescem em resposta ao início da espermatogênese.

O tamanho depende da função lítica, da produção de espermatozoides (quantidade de espermatogênese presente nos testículos), do fluido intersticial e da produção de fluido das células de Sertoli.

Após a puberdade, o volume dos testículos pode ser aumentado em mais de 500% em comparação com o tamanho pré-púbere.

Os testículos descem completamente antes de atingir a puberdade.


== Significado clínico ==

=== Proteção e lesão ===


Os testículos são bem conhecidos por serem muito sensíveis a impactos e lesões.

A dor envolvida viaja de cada testículo para a cavidade abdominal, através do plexo espermático, que é o nervo primário de cada testículo.

Isso causará dor no quadril e nas costas.
A dor geralmente desaparece em alguns minutos.

A torção testicular é uma emergência médica.

A ruptura testicular é uma emergência médica causada por impacto de força contundente, borda afiada ou impacto perfurante em um ou ambos os testículos, o que pode levar à necrose do testículo em menos de 30 minutos.

Lesões penetrantes no escroto podem causar castração, separação física ou destruição dos testículos, possivelmente junto com parte ou todo o pênis, o que resulta em esterilidade total se os testículos não forem recolocados rapidamente.

Algumas jockstraps são projetadas para fornecer suporte aos testículos.


=== Doenças e condições ===

-Câncer testicular e outras neoplasias –

Para melhorar as chances de detectar possíveis casos de câncer testicular ou outros problemas de saúde precocemente, recomenda-se o autoexame testicular regular.

-Varicocele, veia(s) inchada(s) dos testículos, geralmente afetando o lado esquerdo, sendo o testículo geralmente normal.

-Hidrocele testicular, inchaço ao redor dos testículos causado pelo acúmulo de líquido claro dentro de um saco membranoso, sendo o testículo geralmente normal

-Espermatocele, um cisto de retenção de um túbulo da rete testis ou a cabeça do epidídimo distendida com líquido pouco aquoso que contém espermatozóides.

-Distúrbios endócrinos também podem afetar o tamanho e a função do testículo.

- Certas condições hereditárias envolvendo mutações em genes-chave do desenvolvimento também prejudicam a descida testicular, resultando em testículos abdominais ou inguinais que permanecem não funcionais e podem se tornar cancerosos. 

-Outras condições genéticas podem resultar na perda dos ductos de Wolff e permitir a persistência dos ductos de Müller. 

-Tanto o excesso quanto os níveis deficientes de estrogênios podem interromper a espermatogênese e causar infertilidade.

- A deformidade em badalo de sino é uma deformidade na qual o testículo não está preso às paredes escrotais e pode girar livremente no cordão espermático dentro da túnica vaginal.

É a causa subjacente mais comum de torção testicular.

-Orquite inflamação dos testículos
-Epididimite, uma inflamação dolorosa do epidídimo ou epidídimo frequentemente causada por infecção bacteriana, mas às vezes de origem desconhecida.
-Anorchia, a ausência de um ou ambos os testículos.
-Criptorquidia ou "testículos não descidos", quando o testículo não desce para o escroto do menino.
-O aumento testicular é um sinal inespecífico de várias doenças testiculares, e pode ser definido como um tamanho testicular maior que 5 cm (eixo longo) × 3 cm (eixo curto).
-Bolas azuis é uma gíria para uma congestão temporária de fluidos nos testículos e na região da próstata causada por excitação sexual prolongada.
-As próteses testiculares estão disponíveis para mimetizar a aparência e a sensação de um ou ambos os testículos, quando ausentes por lesão ou como tratamento associado à disforia de gênero.

Também houve alguns casos de sua implantação em cães.


=== Efeitos de hormônios exógenos ===

Até certo ponto, é possível alterar o tamanho testicular.

Exceto por lesão direta ou submetê-los a condições adversas, por exemplo, temperatura mais alta do que normalmente estão acostumados, eles podem ser reduzidos ao competir contra sua função hormonal intrínseca através do uso de hormônios esteróides administrados externamente.

Esteróides tomados para aumento muscular (especialmente esteróides anabolizantes) geralmente têm o efeito colateral indesejado de encolhimento testicular.

Da mesma forma, a estimulação das funções testiculares por meio de hormônios gonadotrópicos pode aumentar seu tamanho. 

Os testículos podem encolher ou atrofiar durante a terapia de reposição hormonal ou através da castração química.

Em todos os casos, a perda de volume dos testículos corresponde à perda da espermatogênese.


== Sociedade e cultura ==


Os testículos de bezerros, cordeiros, galos, perus e outros animais são consumidos em muitas partes do mundo, muitas vezes sob nomes culinários eufemísticos. 

Os testículos são um subproduto da castração de animais jovens criados para carne, então eles provavelmente eram uma especialidade sazonal do final da primavera, embora hoje em dia eles sejam geralmente congelados e disponíveis o ano todo.

Já em 330 aC, Aristóteles prescreveu a ligadura (amarração) do testículo esquerdo em homens que desejavam ter meninos.

Na Idade Média, os homens que queriam um menino às vezes tinham o testículo esquerdo removido.

Isso ocorreu porque as pessoas acreditavam que o testículo direito produzia esperma de "menino" e o esquerdo produzia esperma de "menina".


== Etimologia e gíria ==

Uma teoria sobre a etimologia da palavra testis é baseada no direito romano.

A palavra latina original testis, "testemunha", foi usada no princípio legal firmemente estabelecido "Testis unus, testis nullus" (uma testemunha [é igual a] nenhuma testemunha), significando que o testemunho de qualquer pessoa no tribunal deveria ser desconsiderado, a menos que corroborado pelo testemunho de pelo menos outro.

Isso levou à prática comum de apresentar duas testemunhas, subornadas para depor da mesma forma em casos de ações judiciais com segundas intenções.

Como essas "testemunhas" sempre vinham em pares, o significado era estendido de acordo, muitas vezes no diminutivo (testiculus, testiculi).

Outra teoria diz que testículo é influenciado por uma tradução de empréstimo, do grego parastatēs "defensor (na lei), torcedor" que é "duas glândulas lado a lado". para bolas azuis.

Freqüentemente, "nuts" (às vezes intencionalmente escrito incorretamente como "nutz") também é uma gíria para os testes devido à semelhança geométrica, como evidenciado pelos vários usos do termo "Deez Nuts", que incluem um candidato político satírico em 2016 .


== Outros animais ==

=== Aparência externa ===

Nos tubarões, o testículo do lado direito é geralmente maior e, em muitas espécies de aves e mamíferos, o esquerdo pode ser o maior. 

Os peixes primitivos sem mandíbula têm apenas um único testículo, localizado na linha média do corpo, embora mesmo este se forme a partir da fusão de estruturas pareadas no embrião.

Em reprodutores sazonais, o peso dos testículos geralmente aumenta durante a época de reprodução. 

Os testículos de um camelo dromedário são 7-10 cm (2,8-3,9 pol) de comprimento, 4,5 cm (1,8 pol) de profundidade e 5 cm (2,0 pol) de largura. 

O testículo direito é muitas vezes menor que o esquerdo.


=== Localização ===

==== Interno ====

A condição básica para os mamíferos é ter testículos internos. 

Os testículos de monotremados, xenartros e elefantes permanecem dentro do abdômen. 

Existem também alguns marsupiais com testículos externos e mamíferos Boreoeutherianos com testículos internos, como o rinoceronte. 

Cetáceos como baleias e golfinhos também têm testículos internos.

Como os testículos externos aumentariam o arrasto na água, eles têm testículos internos que são mantidos resfriados por sistemas circulatórios especiais que resfriam o sangue arterial que vai para os testículos, colocando as artérias perto das veias que trazem sangue venoso resfriado da pele.

Em odobenídeos e focídeos, a localização dos testículos é para-abdominal, embora os otarídeos tenham testículos escrotais.


==== Externo ====

Os mamíferos terrestres Boreoeutherianos, o grande grupo de mamíferos que inclui os humanos, têm testículos externalizados.

Seus testículos funcionam melhor em temperaturas mais baixas do que a temperatura corporal central.

Seus testículos estão localizados fora do corpo, suspensos pelo cordão espermático dentro do escroto.

Existem várias hipóteses de por que a maioria dos mamíferos boreais têm testículos externos que funcionam melhor a uma temperatura ligeiramente inferior à temperatura corporal central, por exemplo, que está preso a enzimas evoluídas em uma temperatura mais fria devido a testículos externos evoluindo por diferentes razões, que o temperatura mais baixa dos testículos simplesmente é mais eficiente para a produção de esperma.

1) Mais eficiente.

A hipótese clássica é que a temperatura mais baixa dos testículos permite uma espermatogênese fértil mais eficiente.

Em outras palavras, não há enzimas possíveis operando na temperatura corporal central normal que sejam tão eficientes quanto as evoluídas, pelo menos nenhuma aparecendo em nossa evolução até agora.

Os primeiros mamíferos tinham temperaturas corporais mais baixas e, portanto, seus testículos funcionavam eficientemente dentro de seu corpo.

No entanto, argumenta-se que os mamíferos boreotérios têm temperaturas corporais mais altas do que os outros mamíferos e tiveram que desenvolver testículos externos para mantê-los frescos.

Argumenta-se que os mamíferos com testículos internos, como os monotremados, tatus, preguiças, elefantes e rinocerontes, têm uma temperatura corporal central mais baixa do que os mamíferos com testículos externos.

No entanto, a questão permanece por que as aves, apesar de terem temperaturas corporais muito altas, têm testículos internos e não evoluíram testículos externos.

Já foi teorizado que as aves usavam seus sacos de ar para resfriar os testículos internamente, mas estudos posteriores revelaram que os testículos das aves são capazes de funcionar na temperatura corporal central.

Alguns mamíferos que têm ciclos de reprodução sazonais mantêm seus testículos internos até a época de reprodução, quando seus testículos descem e aumentam de tamanho e se tornam externos.

 2) Adaptação irreversível à competição espermática. 

Tem sido sugerido que o ancestral dos mamíferos boreoeutérios era um pequeno mamífero que necessitava de testículos muito grandes (talvez um pouco como os de um hamster) para a competição de esperma e, portanto, tinha que colocar seus testículos fora do corpo. 

Isso levou a enzimas envolvidas na espermatogênese, atividades de DNA polimerase beta e recombinase espermatogênicas desenvolvendo uma temperatura ótima única, ligeiramente inferior à temperatura corporal central. 

Quando os mamíferos boreoeutérios se diversificaram em formas maiores e/ou que não exigiam intensa competição de espermatozóides, eles ainda produziam enzimas que funcionavam melhor em temperaturas mais baixas e tinham que manter seus testículos fora do corpo.

Esta posição torna-se menos parcimoniosa pelo fato de o canguru, um mamífero não-boreoeutério, ter testículos externos.

Os ancestrais dos cangurus podem, separadamente dos mamíferos boreotérios, também terem sido sujeitos a forte competição de espermatozóides e, portanto, desenvolveram testículos externos, no entanto, os testículos externos dos cangurus são sugestivos de uma possível função adaptativa para testículos externos em grandes animais.

3) Proteção contra alterações de pressão da cavidade abdominal.

Um argumento para a evolução dos testículos externos é que eles protegem os testículos das mudanças de pressão da cavidade abdominal causadas por saltos e galopes.

 4) Proteção contra danos no DNA. 

O estresse térmico leve e transitório do escroto causa danos ao DNA, fertilidade reduzida e desenvolvimento embrionário anormal em camundongos. 

Quebras de fita de DNA foram encontradas em espermatócitos recuperados de testículos submetidos a 40°C ou 42°C por 30 minutos. 

Esses achados sugerem que a localização externa dos testículos fornece o benefício adaptativo de proteger as células espermatogênicas de danos no DNA induzidos pelo calor que, de outra forma, poderiam levar à infertilidade e à mutação germinativa.


=== Tamanho ===

O tamanho relativo dos testículos é frequentemente influenciado pelos sistemas de acasalamento. 

O tamanho testicular como proporção do peso corporal varia muito. 

No reino dos mamíferos, há uma tendência para o tamanho testicular corresponder a múltiplos parceiros (por exemplo, haréns, poligamia). 

A produção de espermatozoides testiculares e fluido espermático também é maior em animais polígamos, possivelmente uma competição espermatogênica pela sobrevivência.

Os testículos da baleia franca são provavelmente os maiores de qualquer animal, cada um pesando cerca de 500 kg (1.100 lb).

Entre os Hominidae, os gorilas apresentam pouca promiscuidade feminina e competição espermática e os testículos são pequenos em relação ao peso corporal (0,03%).

Os chimpanzés têm alta promiscuidade e testículos grandes em relação ao peso corporal (0,3%).

O tamanho testicular humano fica entre esses extremos (0,08%). O peso dos testículos também varia em criadores sazonais, como raposas vermelhas, chacais dourados e coiotes.


=== Estrutura interna ===

Sob uma casca membranosa resistente chamada túnica albugínea, os testículos dos amniotas, bem como de alguns peixes teleósteos, contêm tubos enrolados muito finos chamados túbulos seminíferos.

Os anfíbios e a maioria dos peixes não possuem túbulos seminíferos. 

Em vez disso, os espermatozóides são produzidos em estruturas esféricas chamadas ampolas de espermatozóides. 

Estas são estruturas sazonais, liberando seu conteúdo durante a época de reprodução e, em seguida, sendo reabsorvidas pelo organismo. 

Antes da próxima época de reprodução, novas ampolas de esperma começam a se formar e amadurecer. 

As ampolas são essencialmente idênticas aos túbulos seminíferos em vertebrados superiores, incluindo a mesma variedade de tipos de células.
