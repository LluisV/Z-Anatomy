PAROTID GLAND


The parotid gland is a major salivary gland in many animals. 

In humans, the two parotid glands are present on either side of the mouth and in front of both ears. 

They are the largest of the salivary glands. 

Each parotid is wrapped around the mandibular ramus, and secretes serous saliva through the parotid duct into the mouth, to facilitate mastication and swallowing and to begin the digestion of starches. 

There are also two other types of salivary glands; they are submandibular and sublingual glands. 

Sometimes accessory parotid glands are found close to the main parotid glands.


== Etymology ==

The word parotid literally means "beside the ear". 

From Greek παρωτίς (stem παρωτιδ-) : (gland) behind the ear < παρά - pará : in front, and οὖς - ous (stem ὠτ-, ōt-) : ear.


== Structure ==

The parotid glands are a pair of mainly serous salivary glands located below and in front of each ear canal, draining their secretions into the vestibule of the mouth through the parotid duct. 

Each gland lies behind the mandibular ramus and in front of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. 

The gland can be felt on either side, by feeling in front of each ear, along the cheek, and below the angle of the mandible.

The parotid duct, a long excretory duct, emerges from the front of each gland, superficial to the masseter muscle. 

The duct pierces the buccinator muscle, then opens into the mouth on the inner surface of the cheek, usually opposite the maxillary second molar. 

The parotid papilla is a small elevation of tissue that marks the opening of the parotid duct on the inner surface of the cheek.The gland has four surfaces – superficial or lateral, superior, anteromedial, and posteromedial. 

The gland has three borders – anterior, medial, and posterior. 

The parotid gland has two ends – superior end in the form of small superior surface and an inferior end (apex). 

A number of different structures pass through the gland. 

From lateral to medial, these are:

Facial nerve
Retromandibular vein
External carotid artery
Superficial temporal artery
Branches of the great auricular nerve
Maxillary arterySometimes accessory parotid glands are found as an anatomic variation. 

These are close to the main glands and consist of ectopic salivary gland tissue.

Capsule of parotid gland

Capsule of the parotid gland is formed from the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. 

It is supplied by great auricular nerve. 

The fascia splits to enclose the gland. 

This splitting occurs between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process. 

The superficial lamina (parotidomassetric fascia) is thick and is attached to zygomatic arch. 

The deep lamina is thin and is attached to styloid process, tympanic plate and the ramus of the mandible. 

The part of deep lamina extending between the styloid process and the mandible is thickened to form stylomastoid ligament. 

The stylomandibular ligament separates parotid gland from the superficial lobe of the submandibular gland.


=== Location ===

Superficial or lateral relations: 
    The gland is situated deep to the skin, superficial fascia, superficial lamina of investing layer of deep cervical fascia and great auricular nerve (anterior ramus of C2 and C3).

Anteromedial relations: 
    The gland is situated posterolaterally to the mandibular ramus, masseter and medial pterygoid muscles. 

A part of the gland may extend between the ramus and medial pterygoid, as the pterygoid process. 

Branches of facial nerve and parotid duct emerge through this surface.

Posteromedial relations: 
    The gland is situated anterolaterally to mastoid process of temporal bone with its attached sternocleidomastoid and digastric muscles, styloid process of temporal bone with its three attached muscles (stylohyoid, stylopharyngeus, and styloglossus) and carotid sheath with its contained neurovasculature (internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th cranial nerves).

Medial relations: 
    The parotid gland comes into contact with the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle at the medial border, where the anteromedial and posteromedial surfaces meet. 

Hence, a need exists to examine the fauces in parotitis.


=== Blood supply ===

The external carotid artery and its terminal branches within the gland, namely, the superficial temporal and the maxillary artery, also the posterior auricular artery supply the parotid gland. 

Venous return is to the retromandibular veins.


=== Lymphatic drainage ===

The gland is mainly drained into the preauricular or parotid lymph nodes which ultimately drain to the deep cervical chain.


=== Nerve supply ===

The parotid gland receives both sensory and autonomic innervation. 

General sensory innervation to the parotid gland, its sheath, and the overlying skin is provided by the auriculotemporal nerve. 

The autonomic innervation controls the rate of saliva production and is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve.

The cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetic fibres usually lie in the lateral horns of upper thoracic spinal segments (T1-T3). 

Postganglionic sympathetic fibers from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion reach the gland as periarterial nerve plexuses around the external carotid artery and their function is mainly vasoconstriction. 

Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the brain stem from inferior salivatory nucleus in the glossopharyngeal nerve and then through its tympanic and then the lesser petrosal branch pass into the otic ganglion. 

There, they synapse with postganglionic fibers which reach the gland by hitch-hiking via the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve.: 255 


=== Histology ===


The gland has a capsule of its own of dense connective tissue, but is also provided with a false capsule by the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. 

The fascia at the imaginary line between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process splits into a superficial and a deep lamina to enclose the gland. 

The risorius is a small muscle embedded with this capsule substance.
The gland has short, striated ducts and long, intercalated ducts. 

The intercalated ducts are also numerous and lined with cuboidal epithelial cells, and have lumina larger than those of the acini. 

The striated ducts are also numerous and consist of simple columnar epithelium, having striations that represent the infolded basal cell membranes and mitochondria.

Though the parotid gland is the largest, it provides only 25% of the total salivary volume. 

The serous cell predominates in the parotid, making the gland secrete a mainly serous secretory product.

The parotid gland also secretes salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), which is the first step in the decomposition of starches during mastication. 

It is the main exocrine gland to secrete this. 

It breaks down amylose (straight chain starch) and amylopectin (branched starch) by hydrolyzing alpha 1,4 bonds. 

Additionally, the alpha amylase has been suggested to prevent bacterial attachment to oral surfaces and to enable bacterial clearance from the mouth.


== Development ==

The parotid salivary glands appear early in the sixth week of the prenatal development and are the first major salivary glands formed. 

The epithelial buds of these glands are located on the inner part of the cheek, near the labial commissures of the primitive mouth (from ectodermal lining near angles of the stomodeum in the 1st/2nd pharyngeal arches; the stomodeum itself is created from the rupturing of the oropharyngeal membrane at about 26 days.) 

These buds grow posteriorly toward the otic placodes of the ears and branch to form solid cords with rounded terminal ends near the developing facial nerve. 

Later, at around 10 weeks of prenatal development, these cords are canalized and form ducts, with the largest becoming the parotid duct for the parotid gland. 

The rounded terminal ends of the cords form the acini of the glands. 

Secretion by the parotid glands via the parotid duct begins at about 18 weeks of gestation. 

Again, the supporting connective tissue of the gland develops from the surrounding mesenchyme.


== Parotid gland swellings ==

=== Causes ===

==== Mumps ====

Mumps is seen to be a common cause of parotid gland swelling – 85% of cases occur in children younger than 15 years. 

The disease is highly contagious and spreads by airborne droplets from salivary, nasal, and urinary secretions. 

Symptoms include oedema in the area, trismus as well as otalgia. 

The lesion tends to begin on one side of the face and eventually becomes bilateral. 

The transmission of the paramyxovirus is by contact with the infected persons saliva. 

Initial symptoms tend to be a headache and fever. 

Mumps is not fatal, however further complications can include swelling of the ovaries or the testes. 

Diagnosis of mumps is confirmed through viral serology, management of the condition includes hydration and good oral hygiene of the patient requiring excellent motivation. 

However, since the development of the mumps vaccine, given at the age of between 4–6 years, the incidence of this viral infection has greatly reduced. 

This vaccine has reduced the incidence by 99%.


==== Neoplasms ====

===== Benign =====

Neoplastic lesions of the parotid salivary gland can either be benign or malignant. 

Within the parotid gland, nearly 80% of tumours are benign. 

Benign lesions tend to be painless, asymptomatic and slow-growing. 

The most common salivary gland neoplasms in children are hemangiomas, lymphatic malformations, and pleomorphic adenomas. 

Diagnosis of benign lesions require a fine-needle-like aspiration biopsy. 

With various benign lesions, most commonly the pleomorphic adenoma, there is a risk of developing malignancy over time. 

As a result, these lesions are typically resected.

Pleomorphic adenoma is seen to be a common benign neoplasm of the salivary gland and has an overall incidence of 54–68%. 

The Warthin tumour has a lower incidence of 6–10%; this tumour is associated with smoking and is more common in older men. 

Benign lesions of the parotid gland have a significantly higher incidence than malignant lesions.


===== Malignant =====

Malignant salivary gland lesions are rare. 

However, when a tumour extends to the submandibular, sublingual and the minor salivary glands, they tend to be malignant. 

Distinguishing a malignant lesion from a benign one may be difficult as they both present as painless lesions. 

A biopsy is crucial in aiding diagnosis. 

There are common signs that can highlight the presence of a malignant lesion. 

These include facial nerve weakness, rapid increase of the size of the lump as well as ulceration of the mucosa of the skin.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a common malignant tumour of the salivary glands and has a low incidence of 4–13%. 

Adenoid cystic carcinoma is also a common malignant salivary gland lesion and has an incidence of 4–8%. 

This carcinoma tends to invade nerves and can re-occur post-treatment.


==== Polycystic Parotid Disease ====

A developmental polycystic disease of the salivary gland is seen to be extremely rare and is seen to be independent of recurrent parotitis. 

The cause is thought to be a defect in the interactions between activin, follistatin and TGF-β, leading to a developmental disorder of glandular tissue.


== Clinical significance ==

=== Parotitis ===

Inflammation of one or both parotid glands is known as parotitis. 

The most common cause of parotitis is mumps. 

Widespread vaccination against mumps has markedly reduced the incidence of mumps parotitis. 

The pain of mumps is due to the swelling of the gland within its fibrous capsule.

Apart from viral infection, other infections, such as bacterial, can cause parotitis (acute suppurative parotitis or chronic parotitis). 

These infections may cause blockage of the duct by salivary duct calculi or external compression. 

Parotid gland swellings can also be due to benign lymphoepithelial lesions caused by Mikulicz disease and Sjögren syndrome. 

Swelling of the parotid gland may also indicate the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, creating the look of a heavy jaw line. 

With the inflammation of mumps or obstruction of the ducts, increased levels of the salivary alpha amylase secreted by the parotid gland can be detected in the blood stream.


=== Fibrous reactions ===

Tuberculosis and syphilis can cause granuloma formation in the parotid glands.


=== Salivary stones ===

Salivary stones mainly occur within the main confluence of the ducts and within the main parotid duct. 

The patient usually complains of intense pain when salivating and tends to avoid foods which produce this symptom. 

In addition, the parotid gland may become enlarged upon trying to eat. 

The pain can be reproduced in clinic by squirting lemon juice into the mouth. 

Surgery depends upon the site of the stone: if within the anterior aspect of the duct, a simple incision into the buccal mucosa with sphinterotomy may allow removal; however, if situated more posteriorly within the main duct, complete gland excision may be necessary.


=== Injury ===

The parotid salivary gland can also be pierced and the facial nerve temporarily traumatized when an inferior alveolar local anesthesia nerve block is incorrectly administered, causing transient facial paralysis.


=== Cancer and tumours ===

About 80% of tumors of the parotid gland are benign. 

The most common of these include pleomorphic adenoma (70% of tumors, of which 60% occur in females) and Warthin tumor (i.e. adenolymphoma, which is more common in males than in females). 

Their importance is in relation to their anatomical position and tendency to grow over time. 

The tumorous growth can also change the consistency of the gland and cause facial pain on the involved side.

Around 20% of parotid tumors are malignant, with the most common tumors being mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. 

Other malignant tumors of the parotid gland include acinic cell carcinoma, carcinoma expleomorphic adenoma, adenocarcinoma (arising from ductal epithelium of parotid gland), squamous cell carcinoma (arising from parenchyma of parotid gland), and undifferentiated carcinoma. 

Metastasis from other sites like phyllodes tumour of breast presenting as parotid swelling have also been described. 

Critically, the relationship of the tumor to the branches of the facial nerve (CN VII) must be defined because resection may damage the nerves, resulting in paralysis of the muscles of facial expression.


=== Surgery ===

Surgical treatment of parotid gland tumors is sometimes difficult because of the anatomical relations of the facial nerve parotid lodge, as well as the increased potential for postoperative relapse. 

Thus, detection of early stages of a parotid tumor is extremely important in terms of postoperative prognosis. 

Operative technique is laborious, because of relapses and incomplete previous treatment made in other border specialties. 

Surgical techniques in parotid surgery have evolved in the last years with the use of neuromonitoring of the facial nerve and have become safer and less invasive.

After surgical removal of the parotid gland (Parotidectomy), the auriculotemporal nerve is liable to damage and upon recovery it fuses with sweat glands. 

This can cause sweating on the cheek on the side of the face of the affected gland. 

This condition is known as Frey's syndrome.


== Infections ==

=== Bacterial infections ===

==== Acute bacterial parotitis ====

Commonly caused by a retrograde bacterial infection as a result of illness, sepsis, trauma, surgery, reduced salivary flow due to medications, diabetes, malnutrition and dehydration. 

Classically symptoms of painful swelling in the parotid region when eating seen. 

Management is based upon antibacterials, rehydration combined with gentle massage to encourage salivary flow.


==== Chronic bacterial parotitis ====

A latent infection despite clinical resolution of the disease resulting in impaired function. 

Histologically glandular duct dilation, abscess formation and atrophy may be seen. 

Parotid secretions are viscous. 

Disease course shows pain and swelling, waxing and waning. 

Radiographic screening should be undertaken to rule out sialolith. 

Management with palliative care with parotidectomy as a last resort.



=== Viral infections ===

==== Mumps ====

Acute non-suppurative disease that often occurs in epidemics. 

Prevented by MMR vaccine. 

Caused by paramyxovirus that is transmitted by infected saliva and urine. 

A prodromal period of 24–28 hours is experienced, followed by rapid and painful swelling of the parotid gland. 

Treatment is supportive (bedrest, hydration) as spontaneous resolution occurs within 5–10 days.


==== HIV / AIDS ====

Diffuse gland enlargement is seen, and may affect patients throughout all stages of the infection. 

Lymphoepithelial cysts seen via imaging help aid diagnosis. 

Pathogenic process occurs due to circulating CD8 lymphocytes within the salivary gland. 

Medical management via use of antiretrovirals, excellent oral hygiene measures and sialogogues.


=== Autoimmune related ===

==== Systemic lupus erythematosus ====

Most commonly seen in fourth and fifth decades in women, and can affect any salivary gland. 

Presentation is a slowly enlarging gland, with diagnosis made by identification of the underlying systemic disorder and measurements of salivary chemical levels. 

Sodium and chloride ion levels will be elevated two or three times normal levels. 

Treatment is by addressing the underlying systemic condition.


==== Sarcoidosis ====

Sarcoidosis is a chronic systemic disease characterised by the production of non-caseating granulomas of unknown aetiology. 

It can affect any organ of the body, depressing cellular immunity and enhancing humoral immunity.

Salivary gland involvement primarily involves the parotid gland, causing enlargement and swelling. 

Salivary gland biopsy with histopathologic examination is needed to make the distinction between whether Sjoren’s syndrome or sarcoidosis is the cause of this.


==== Sjogren's syndrome ====

Salivary gland enlargement occurs in up to 30% of patients with Sjogren’s syndrome, with the parotid gland being most often enlarged, and bilateral parotid gland enlargement seen in 25–60% of patients. 

However, the parotid glands have a longer-lasting secretory capacity in Sjogren’s syndrome patient and therefore are the last glands to manifest hyposalivation in the disease. 

Histopathology shows clustering of lymphocytic infiltrates and epimyoepithelial islands.


=== Mycobacterial infection ===


The most common head and neck manifestation of tuberculosis mycobacterial disease is infection of cervical lymph nodes. 

The infection is thought to originate in the tonsils or gingiva, ascending to the parotid gland. 

Two clinical forms; acute and chronic lesions. 

Acute lesions have diffuse glandular edema, easily confused with acute sialdentitis or abscess. 

The chronic lesions occur as slow growing masses mimicking tumors.


== Examination of the salivary gland ==



=== History and examination ===

A patient with parotid swelling may complain of swelling, pain, xerostomia, bad taste and sometimes sialorrhoea.

The most common presenting symptom of neoplasms (both benign and malignant) is an asymptomatic swelling. 

Pain is more common in patients with parotid cancer (10–29% feel pain) than those with benign neoplasms (only 2.5–4%), but pain itself it not diagnostic of malignancy.

Episodic swelling of major salivary glands accompanied by pain and related to salivary stimuli suggests duct obstruction.

Also need to assess the facial nerve. 

The facial nerve passes through the parotid so may be affected if there is a change in the parotid gland. 

Facial nerve paralysis in a previously untreated patient usually indicates that a tumour is malignant.


=== Physical examination ===

The superficial location of the salivary glands allows palpation and visual inspection. 

The inspection must be systematic, both intraorally and extraorally, so no area is missed.

For extraoral examination the patients head should be inclined forwards in order to maximally expose the parotid and submandibular glands. 

A normal parotid gland is barely palpable and a normal sublingual gland is not palpable.Intra-oral examination should include observations for asymmetry, discolouration, pulsation and obstructions in the duct orifices. 

Swelling of the deep lobe of the parotid gland may be seen intra-orally, and may also displace the tonsil. 

The minor salivary glands should be examined. 

The labial, buccal and posterior palatal mucosa should be dried with an air blower or tissue and pressed to assess the flow of saliva.


=== Salivary testing ===

Salivary stimulation

This can be done by palpating the parotid gland, thus stimulating it. 

Assess to see whether there is saliva flowing from the parotid papilla.Sialography

Sialograms can identify changes in salivary gland architecture and are useful in the evaluation of major gland swellings.

It involves the instillation of a radio-opaque fluid into the major gland ductal system. 

This outlines the major and minor ductal systems, and also gives an outline of the glandular tissue.

For example, sialadenitis creates an appearance known as “pruning of the tree” on a sialogram, where there are less branches visible from the duct system. 

Also, a space occupying lesion that occurs within or adjacent to a salivary gland can displace the normal anatomy of the gland. 

This may create an appearance known as “ball in hand” on a sialogram, where the ducts are curved around the mass of the lesion.Sialochemistry

The composition of saliva changes in disease states, and analysis of saliva for enzymes, electrolytes, hormones, drugs and immunisation status can be performed.Radioisotope scintigraphy 

Gives an objective measure of isotope uptake and excretion using a gamma scintillation camera. 

After about 20 minutes, a salivary stimulant will be given to promote salivary flow through the gland. 

They are used to assess patients with persistent symptoms of dry mouth and also to evaluate salivary gland swelling due to infection, inflammation or obstruction.


=== Further tests ===

-Imagining techniques

-Ultrasounds, CT Scans or MRIs can aid with disease localisation

-Sialoendoscopy

-A camera is inserted into the duct of a salivary gland to assess blockages

-Biopsy

-This can be done by fine needle aspiration biopsy, which provides an opportunity to obtain information about the histology of a salivary tumour prior to initiation of treatment.

GLÁNDULA PARÓTIDA


La glándula parótida es una glándula salival importante en muchos animales.

En los humanos, las dos glándulas parótidas están presentes a cada lado de la boca y frente a ambos oídos.

Son las más grandes de las glándulas salivales.

Cada parótida se envuelve alrededor de la rama mandibular y secreta saliva serosa a través del conducto parotídeo hacia la boca, para facilitar la masticación y la deglución y para comenzar la digestión de los almidones.

También hay otros dos tipos de glándulas salivales; son glándulas submandibulares y sublinguales.

A veces, las glándulas parótidas accesorias se encuentran cerca de las glándulas parótidas principales.


== Etimología ==

La palabra parótida significa literalmente "al lado de la oreja".

Del griego παρωτίς (raíz παρωτιδ-) : (glándula) detrás de la oreja < παρά - pará : delante, y οὖς - ous (raíz ὠτ-, ōt-): oreja.


== Estructura ==

Las glándulas parótidas son un par de glándulas salivales principalmente serosas ubicadas debajo y delante de cada canal auditivo, drenando sus secreciones hacia el vestíbulo de la boca a través del conducto parotídeo. 

Cada glándula se encuentra detrás de la rama mandibular y frente al proceso mastoideo del hueso temporal. 

La glándula se puede palpar a ambos lados, palpándose delante de cada oreja, a lo largo de la mejilla y debajo del ángulo de la mandíbula.

El conducto parotídeo, un conducto excretor largo, emerge del frente de cada glándula, superficial al músculo masetero. 

El conducto perfora el músculo buccinador y luego se abre hacia la boca en la superficie interna de la mejilla, generalmente frente al segundo molar superior. 

La papila parotídea es una pequeña elevación de tejido que marca la abertura del conducto parotídeo en la superficie interna de la mejilla. La glándula tiene cuatro superficies: superficial o lateral, superior, anteromedial y posteromedial.

La glándula tiene tres bordes: anterior, medial y posterior.

La glándula parótida tiene dos extremos: el extremo superior en forma de pequeña superficie superior y el extremo inferior (ápice).

Varias estructuras diferentes pasan a través de la glándula.

De lateral a medial, estos son:

Nervio facial
Vena retromandibular
Arteria carótida externa
Arteria temporal superficial
Ramas del nervio auricular mayor
Arteria maxilarA veces se encuentran glándulas parótidas accesorias como una variación anatómica.

Estos están cerca de las glándulas principales y consisten en tejido de glándulas salivales ectópicas.

Cápsula de la glándula parótida

La cápsula de la glándula parótida se forma a partir de la capa de revestimiento de la fascia cervical profunda. 

Está inervado por el nervio auricular mayor. 

La fascia se divide para encerrar la glándula. 

Esta división se produce entre el ángulo de la mandíbula y el proceso mastoideo. 

La lámina superficial (fascia parotidomassétrica) es gruesa y está unida al arco cigomático. 

La lámina profunda es delgada y está unida a la apófisis estiloides, la placa timpánica y la rama de la mandíbula. 

La parte de la lámina profunda que se extiende entre la apófisis estiloides y la mandíbula se engrosa para formar el ligamento estilomastoideo. 

El ligamento estilomandibular separa la glándula parótida del lóbulo superficial de la glándula submandibular.


=== Ubicación ===

Relaciones superficiales o laterales: 
 La glándula está situada por debajo de la piel, la fascia superficial, la lámina superficial de la capa de inversión de la fascia cervical profunda y el nervio auricular mayor (rama anterior de C2 y C3).

Relaciones anteromediales: 
 La glándula está situada posterolateralmente a la rama mandibular, los músculos masetero y pterigoideo medial. 

Una parte de la glándula puede extenderse entre la rama y el pterigoideo medial, como el proceso pterigoideo. 

Las ramas del nervio facial y el conducto parotídeo emergen a través de esta superficie.

Relaciones posteromediales: 
La glándula está situada anterolateralmente a la apófisis mastoides del hueso temporal con sus músculos esternocleidomastoideo y digástrico adjuntos, la apófisis estiloides del hueso temporal con sus tres músculos adjuntos (estilohioideo, estilofaríngeo y estilogloso) y la vaina carotídea con su neurovasculatura contenida (arteria carótida interna, arteria carótida interna, vena yugular y los nervios craneales 9, 10, 11 y 12).

Relaciones mediales:
La glándula parótida entra en contacto con el músculo constrictor faríngeo superior en el borde medial, donde se unen las superficies anteromedial y posteromedial.

Por lo tanto, existe la necesidad de examinar las fauces en la parotiditis.


=== Suministro de sangre ===

La arteria carótida externa y sus ramas terminales dentro de la glándula, a saber, la arteria temporal superficial y la maxilar, también la arteria auricular posterior irrigan la glándula parótida.

El retorno venoso es a las venas retromandibulares.


=== Drenaje linfático ===

La glándula se drena principalmente en los ganglios linfáticos preauriculares o parotídeos que finalmente drenan en la cadena cervical profunda.


=== Suministro nervioso ===

La glándula parótida recibe inervación sensorial y autonómica.

El nervio auriculotemporal proporciona la inervación sensitiva general de la glándula parótida, su vaina y la piel que la recubre.

La inervación autonómica controla la tasa de producción de saliva y es suministrada por el nervio glosofaríngeo.

Los cuerpos celulares de las fibras simpáticas preganglionares por lo general se encuentran en las astas laterales de los segmentos espinales torácicos superiores (T1-T3).

Las fibras simpáticas posganglionares del ganglio simpático cervical superior alcanzan la glándula como plexos nerviosos periarteriales alrededor de la arteria carótida externa y su función es principalmente vasoconstrictora.

Las fibras parasimpáticas preganglionares salen del tronco encefálico desde el núcleo salival inferior en el nervio glosofaríngeo y luego a través de su rama timpánica y luego la rama petrosa menor pasan al ganglio ótico. 

Allí hacen sinapsis con fibras posganglionares que llegan a la glándula haciendo autostop a través del nervio auriculotemporal, rama del nervio mandibular.: 255 


=== Histología ===


La glándula tiene una cápsula propia de tejido conjuntivo denso, pero también está provista de una cápsula falsa por la capa de revestimiento de la fascia cervical profunda. 

La fascia en la línea imaginaria entre el ángulo de la mandíbula y el proceso mastoideo se divide en una lámina superficial y otra profunda para encerrar la glándula. 

El risorio es un pequeño músculo incrustado con esta sustancia de la cápsula.
La glándula tiene conductos estriados cortos y conductos intercalados largos. 

Los conductos intercalados también son numerosos y están revestidos de células epiteliales cuboidales y tienen luces más grandes que las de los ácinos.

Los conductos estriados también son numerosos y consisten en epitelio cilíndrico simple, con estrías que representan las membranas celulares basales plegadas y las mitocondrias.

Aunque la glándula parótida es la más grande, proporciona solo el 25% del volumen salival total.

La célula serosa predomina en la parótida, haciendo que la glándula secrete un producto secretor principalmente seroso.

La glándula parótida también secreta alfa-amilasa salival (sAA), que es el primer paso en la descomposición de los almidones durante la masticación.

Es la principal glándula exocrina para secretar esto.

Descompone la amilosa (almidón de cadena lineal) y la amilopectina (almidón ramificado) hidrolizando los enlaces alfa 1,4.

Además, se ha sugerido que la alfa amilasa evita que las bacterias se adhieran a las superficies bucales y permite la eliminación de bacterias de la boca.


== Desarrollo ==

Las glándulas salivales parótidas aparecen a principios de la sexta semana del desarrollo prenatal y son las primeras glándulas salivales mayores que se forman.

Las yemas epiteliales de estas glándulas están ubicadas en la parte interna de la mejilla, cerca de las comisuras labiales de la boca primitiva (desde el revestimiento ectodérmico cerca de los ángulos del estomodeo en los arcos faríngeos primero y segundo; el estomodeo en sí se crea a partir de la ruptura de la membrana orofaríngea alrededor de los 26 días).

Estos brotes crecen posteriormente hacia las placodas óticas de las orejas y se ramifican para formar cordones sólidos con extremos terminales redondeados cerca del nervio facial en desarrollo.

Más tarde, alrededor de las 10 semanas de desarrollo prenatal, estos cordones se canalizan y forman conductos, y el más grande se convierte en el conducto parotídeo para la glándula parótida. 

Los extremos terminales redondeados de los cordones forman los ácinos de las glándulas. 

La secreción de las glándulas parótidas a través del conducto parotídeo comienza alrededor de las 18 semanas de gestación. 

De nuevo, el tejido conjuntivo de sostén de la glándula se desarrolla a partir del mesénquima circundante.


== Inflamaciones de las glándulas parótidas ==

=== Causas ===

==== Paperas ====

Se considera que las paperas son una causa común de inflamación de la glándula parótida: el 85% de los casos ocurren en niños menores de 15 años. 

La enfermedad es altamente contagiosa y se propaga a través de gotitas en el aire de las secreciones salivales, nasales y urinarias. 

Los síntomas incluyen edema en el área, trismo y otalgia. 

La lesión tiende a comenzar en un lado de la cara y eventualmente se vuelve bilateral. 

La transmisión del paramixovirus es por contacto con la saliva de las personas infectadas. 

Los síntomas iniciales suelen ser dolor de cabeza y fiebre. 

Las paperas no son fatales, sin embargo, otras complicaciones pueden incluir hinchazón de los ovarios o los testículos. 

El diagnóstico de paperas se confirma a través de la serología viral, el manejo de la condición incluye la hidratación y una buena higiene bucal del paciente que requiere una excelente motivación. 

Sin embargo, desde el desarrollo de la vacuna contra las paperas, administrada a la edad de entre 4 y 6 años, la incidencia de esta infección viral se ha reducido considerablemente. 

Esta vacuna ha reducido la incidencia en un 99%.


==== Neoplasias ====

===== Benigno =====

Las lesiones neoplásicas de la glándula salival parótida pueden ser benignas o malignas. 

Dentro de la glándula parótida, casi el 80% de los tumores son benignos. 

Las lesiones benignas tienden a ser indoloras, asintomáticas y de crecimiento lento. 

Las neoplasias de glándulas salivales más frecuentes en niños son los hemangiomas, las malformaciones linfáticas y los adenomas pleomorfos.

El diagnóstico de lesiones benignas requiere una biopsia por aspiración con aguja fina.

Con varias lesiones benignas, más comúnmente el adenoma pleomórfico, existe el riesgo de desarrollar malignidad con el tiempo.

Como resultado, estas lesiones suelen ser resecadas.

Se considera que el adenoma pleomórfico es una neoplasia benigna común de la glándula salival y tiene una incidencia general de 54 a 68%.

El tumor de Warthin tiene una incidencia menor de 6 a 10%; este tumor está asociado con el tabaquismo y es más común en hombres mayores.

Las lesiones benignas de la glándula parótida tienen una incidencia significativamente mayor que las lesiones malignas.


===== Maligno =====

Las lesiones malignas de las glándulas salivales son raras.

Sin embargo, cuando un tumor se extiende a las glándulas salivales menores, submandibulares y sublinguales, tienden a ser malignos. 

Distinguir una lesión maligna de una benigna puede ser difícil ya que ambas se presentan como lesiones indoloras. 

Una biopsia es crucial para ayudar al diagnóstico. 

Hay signos comunes que pueden resaltar la presencia de una lesión maligna. 

Estos incluyen debilidad del nervio facial, aumento rápido del tamaño del bulto y ulceración de la mucosa de la piel.

El carcinoma mucoepidermoide es un tumor maligno común de las glándulas salivales y tiene una incidencia baja de 4 a 13%. 

El carcinoma adenoide quístico también es una lesión maligna común de las glándulas salivales y tiene una incidencia de 4 a 8%. 

Este carcinoma tiende a invadir los nervios y puede reaparecer después del tratamiento.


==== Enfermedad de Parótida Poliquística ====

Se considera que una enfermedad poliquística del desarrollo de la glándula salival es extremadamente rara y es independiente de la parotiditis recurrente.

Se cree que la causa es un defecto en las interacciones entre la activina, la folistatina y el TGF-β, lo que conduce a un trastorno del desarrollo del tejido glandular.


== Importancia clínica ==

=== Parotiditis ===

La inflamación de una o ambas glándulas parótidas se conoce como parotiditis.

La causa más común de parotiditis son las paperas.

La vacunación generalizada contra las paperas ha reducido notablemente la incidencia de parotiditis por paperas.

El dolor de las paperas se debe a la inflamación de la glándula dentro de su cápsula fibrosa.

Aparte de la infección viral, otras infecciones, como las bacterianas, pueden causar parotiditis (parotitis supurativa aguda o parotiditis crónica).

Estas infecciones pueden causar el bloqueo del conducto por cálculos del conducto salival o compresión externa.

Las inflamaciones de las glándulas parótidas también pueden deberse a lesiones linfoepiteliales benignas causadas por la enfermedad de Mikulicz y el síndrome de Sjögren. 

La inflamación de la glándula parótida también puede indicar el trastorno alimentario bulimia nerviosa, lo que crea la apariencia de una mandíbula marcada. 

Con la inflamación de las paperas o la obstrucción de los conductos, se pueden detectar niveles elevados de alfa amilasa salival secretada por la glándula parótida en el torrente sanguíneo.


=== Reacciones fibrosas ===

La tuberculosis y la sífilis pueden causar la formación de granulomas en las glándulas parótidas.


=== Cálculos salivales ===

Los cálculos salivales ocurren principalmente dentro de la confluencia principal de los conductos y dentro del conducto parotídeo principal. 

El paciente suele quejarse de dolor intenso al salivar y tiende a evitar los alimentos que le producen este síntoma. 

Además, la glándula parótida puede agrandarse al intentar comer. 

El dolor se puede reproducir en la clínica rociando jugo de limón en la boca.

La cirugía depende del sitio del cálculo: si está dentro de la cara anterior del conducto, una simple incisión en la mucosa bucal con esfinterotomía puede permitir la extracción; sin embargo, si se sitúa más posteriormente dentro del conducto principal, puede ser necesaria la extirpación completa de la glándula.


=== Lesión ===

La glándula salival parótida también se puede perforar y el nervio facial se puede traumatizar temporalmente cuando se administra incorrectamente un bloqueo nervioso de anestesia local alveolar inferior, lo que provoca una parálisis facial transitoria.


=== Cáncer y tumores ===

Alrededor del 80% de los tumores de la glándula parótida son benignos.

Los más comunes incluyen el adenoma pleomórfico (el 70 % de los tumores, de los cuales el 60 % se presenta en mujeres) y el tumor de Warthin (es decir, el adenolinfoma, que es más común en hombres que en mujeres).

Su importancia está en relación con su posición anatómica y su tendencia a crecer con el tiempo.

El crecimiento tumoral también puede cambiar la consistencia de la glándula y causar dolor facial en el lado afectado.

Alrededor del 20% de los tumores de parótida son malignos, siendo los tumores más frecuentes el carcinoma mucoepidermoide y el carcinoma adenoide quístico.

Otros tumores malignos de la glándula parótida incluyen carcinoma de células acínicas, adenoma carcinoma expleomórfico, adenocarcinoma (que surge del epitelio ductal de la glándula parótida), carcinoma de células escamosas (que surge del parénquima de la glándula parótida) y carcinoma indiferenciado.

También se han descrito metástasis de otros sitios, como el tumor filoides de la mama que se presenta como inflamación de la parótida.

Es fundamental definir la relación del tumor con las ramas del nervio facial (CN VII) porque la resección puede dañar los nervios y provocar la parálisis de los músculos de la expresión facial.


=== Cirugía ===

El tratamiento quirúrgico de los tumores de la glándula parótida a veces es difícil debido a las relaciones anatómicas del alojamiento parotídeo del nervio facial, así como al mayor potencial de recaída posoperatoria.

Por lo tanto, la detección de estadios tempranos de un tumor parotídeo es extremadamente importante en términos de pronóstico postoperatorio.

La técnica quirúrgica es laboriosa, por las recaídas y tratamientos previos incompletos realizados en otras especialidades fronterizas.

Las técnicas quirúrgicas en cirugía parotídea han evolucionado en los últimos años con el uso de la neuromonitorización del nervio facial y se han vuelto más seguras y menos invasivas.

Después de la extirpación quirúrgica de la glándula parótida (parotidectomía), el nervio auriculotemporal está sujeto a daños y, al recuperarse, se fusiona con las glándulas sudoríparas. 

Esto puede causar sudoración en la mejilla del lado de la cara de la glándula afectada. 

Esta condición se conoce como síndrome de Frey.


== Infecciones ==

=== Infecciones bacterianas ===

==== Parotiditis bacteriana aguda ====

Comúnmente causado por una infección bacteriana retrógrada como resultado de una enfermedad, sepsis, trauma, cirugía, flujo salival reducido debido a medicamentos, diabetes, desnutrición y deshidratación. 

Clásicamente se observan síntomas de hinchazón dolorosa en la región parotídea al comer. 

El manejo se basa en antibacterianos, rehidratación combinada con masaje suave para estimular el flujo salival.


==== Parotiditis bacteriana crónica ====

Una infección latente a pesar de la resolución clínica de la enfermedad que resulta en un deterioro de la función. 

Histológicamente puede observarse dilatación del conducto glandular, formación de abscesos y atrofia.

Las secreciones parótidas son viscosas.

El curso de la enfermedad muestra dolor e hinchazón, aumentando y disminuyendo.

Se debe realizar un examen radiográfico para descartar sialolito.

Manejo con cuidados paliativos con parotidectomía como último recurso.



=== Infecciones virales ===

==== Paperas ====

Enfermedad aguda no supurativa que a menudo ocurre en epidemias.

Prevenido por la vacuna MMR.

Causada por el paramixovirus que se transmite por la saliva y la orina infectadas.

Se experimenta un período prodrómico de 24 a 28 horas, seguido de inflamación rápida y dolorosa de la glándula parótida.

El tratamiento es de apoyo (reposo en cama, hidratación) ya que la resolución espontánea ocurre dentro de 5 a 10 días.


==== VIH / SIDA ====

Se observa agrandamiento difuso de la glándula y puede afectar a los pacientes en todas las etapas de la infección.

Los quistes linfoepiteliales vistos a través de imágenes ayudan al diagnóstico.

El proceso patogénico ocurre debido a los linfocitos CD8 circulantes dentro de la glándula salival.

Manejo médico mediante uso de antirretrovirales, excelentes medidas de higiene bucal y sialogogos.


=== Relacionado con la autoinmunidad ===

==== Lupus eritematoso sistémico ====

Se observa con mayor frecuencia en la cuarta y quinta décadas en mujeres y puede afectar cualquier glándula salival.

La presentación es una glándula que crece lentamente, con diagnóstico realizado por identificación del trastorno sistémico subyacente y mediciones de los niveles químicos salivales.

Los niveles de iones de sodio y cloruro se elevarán dos o tres veces los niveles normales.

El tratamiento consiste en abordar la afección sistémica subyacente.


==== Sarcoidosis ====

La sarcoidosis es una enfermedad sistémica crónica caracterizada por la producción de granulomas no caseificantes de etiología desconocida.

Puede afectar cualquier órgano del cuerpo, deprimiendo la inmunidad celular y mejorando la inmunidad humoral.

La afectación de las glándulas salivales afecta principalmente a la glándula parótida, lo que provoca agrandamiento e hinchazón.

Se necesita una biopsia de la glándula salival con examen histopatológico para distinguir si la causa es el síndrome de Sjoren o la sarcoidosis.


==== Síndrome de Sjogren ====

El agrandamiento de las glándulas salivales ocurre hasta en 30% de los pacientes con síndrome de Sjogren, siendo la glándula parótida la más a menudo agrandada y el agrandamiento bilateral de la glándula parótida se observa en 25 a 60% de los pacientes.

Sin embargo, las glándulas parótidas tienen una capacidad secretora más duradera en el paciente con síndrome de Sjogren y, por lo tanto, son las últimas glándulas en manifestar hiposalivación en la enfermedad.

La histopatología muestra un agrupamiento de infiltrados linfocíticos e islas epimioepiteliales.


=== Infección micobacteriana ===


La manifestación más común de cabeza y cuello de la enfermedad micobacteriana tuberculosa es la infección de los ganglios linfáticos cervicales. 

Se cree que la infección se origina en las amígdalas o la encía y asciende a la glándula parótida. 

Dos formas clínicas; lesiones agudas y crónicas.

Las lesiones agudas tienen edema glandular difuso, fácilmente confundido con sialdentitis aguda o absceso. 

Las lesiones crónicas se presentan como masas de crecimiento lento que simulan tumores.


== Examen de la glándula salival ==



=== Historia y examen ===

Un paciente con tumefacción parotídea puede quejarse de tumefacción, dolor, xerostomía, mal sabor de boca y, en ocasiones, sialorrea.

El síntoma de presentación más común de las neoplasias (tanto benignas como malignas) es una inflamación asintomática. 

El dolor es más común en pacientes con cáncer de parótida (10 a 29% siente dolor) que en aquellos con neoplasias benignas (solo 2.5 a 4%), pero el dolor en sí mismo no es diagnóstico de malignidad.

La tumefacción episódica de las glándulas salivales mayores acompañada de dolor y relacionada con estímulos salivales sugiere obstrucción del conducto.

También es necesario evaluar el nervio facial. 

El nervio facial pasa a través de la parótida, por lo que puede verse afectado si hay un cambio en la glándula parótida. 

La parálisis del nervio facial en un paciente no tratado previamente suele indicar que un tumor es maligno.


=== Exploración física ===

La ubicación superficial de las glándulas salivales permite la palpación y la inspección visual. 

La inspección debe ser sistemática, tanto intraoral como extraoralmente, de modo que no se pase por alto ninguna zona.

Para el examen extraoral, la cabeza del paciente debe estar inclinada hacia adelante para exponer al máximo las glándulas parótidas y submandibulares. 

Una glándula parótida normal es apenas palpable y una glándula sublingual normal no es palpable. El examen intraoral debe incluir observaciones de asimetría, decoloración, pulsación y obstrucciones en los orificios del conducto. 

La inflamación del lóbulo profundo de la glándula parótida puede verse intraoralmente y también puede desplazar la amígdala. 

Se deben examinar las glándulas salivales menores. 

La mucosa labial, bucal y palatina posterior debe secarse con un soplador de aire o un pañuelo y presionarse para evaluar el flujo de saliva.


=== Prueba salival ===

Estimulación salival

Esto se puede hacer palpando la glándula parótida, estimulándola así. 

Evaluar para ver si sale saliva de la papila parotídea. Sialografía

Los sialogramas pueden identificar cambios en la arquitectura de las glándulas salivales y son útiles en la evaluación de inflamaciones importantes de las glándulas.

Implica la instilación de un líquido radiopaco en el sistema ductal de la glándula principal.

Esto delinea los sistemas ductales mayores y menores, y también brinda un esquema del tejido glandular.

Por ejemplo, la sialoadenitis crea una apariencia conocida como "poda del árbol" en un sialograma, donde hay menos ramas visibles desde el sistema de conductos.

Además, una lesión que ocupa espacio que se produce dentro o junto a una glándula salival puede desplazar la anatomía normal de la glándula.

Esto puede crear una apariencia conocida como "pelota en mano" en un sialograma, donde los conductos se curvan alrededor de la masa de la lesión. Sialoquímica

La composición de los cambios de saliva en estados de enfermedad, y se puede realizar un análisis de saliva para enzimas, electrolitos, hormonas, drogas y estado de inmunización. Gammagrafía con radioisótopos 

Da una medida objetiva de la absorción y excreción de isótopos utilizando una cámara de centelleo gamma. 

Después de unos 20 minutos, se administrará un estimulante salival para promover el flujo salival a través de la glándula. 

Se utilizan para evaluar pacientes con síntomas persistentes de boca seca y también para evaluar la inflamación de las glándulas salivales debido a una infección, inflamación u obstrucción.


=== Más pruebas ===

-Técnicas de imaginación

-Ultrasonidos, tomografías computarizadas o resonancias magnéticas pueden ayudar con la localización de la enfermedad

-Sialoendoscopia

-Se inserta una cámara en el conducto de una glándula salival para evaluar obstrucciones

-Biopsia

-Esto se puede hacer mediante una biopsia por aspiración con aguja fina, que brinda la oportunidad de obtener información sobre la histología de un tumor salival antes de iniciar el tratamiento.

GLANDE PAROTIDE


La glande parotide est une glande salivaire majeure chez de nombreux animaux.

Chez l'homme, les deux glandes parotides sont présentes de chaque côté de la bouche et devant les deux oreilles.

Ce sont les plus grosses des glandes salivaires.

Chaque parotide est enroulée autour de la branche mandibulaire et sécrète de la salive séreuse à travers le canal parotidien dans la bouche, pour faciliter la mastication et la déglutition et pour commencer la digestion des amidons.

Il existe également deux autres types de glandes salivaires; ce sont des glandes submandibulaires et sublinguales.

Parfois, des glandes parotides accessoires se trouvent à proximité des glandes parotides principales.


== Étymologie ==

Le mot parotide signifie littéralement "à côté de l'oreille".

Du grec παρωτίς (racine παρωτιδ-) : (glande) derrière l'oreille < παρά - pará : devant, et οὖς - ous (racine ὠτ-, ōt-) : oreille.


== Structure ==

Les glandes parotides sont une paire de glandes salivaires principalement séreuses situées en dessous et devant chaque conduit auditif, drainant leurs sécrétions dans le vestibule de la bouche par le conduit parotidien.

Chaque glande se trouve derrière la branche mandibulaire et devant le processus mastoïdien de l'os temporal.

La glande peut être ressentie de chaque côté, en sentant devant chaque oreille, le long de la joue et sous l'angle de la mandibule.

Le canal parotidien, un long canal excréteur, émerge de l'avant de chaque glande, superficiel par rapport au muscle masséter.

Le canal perce le muscle buccinateur, puis débouche dans la bouche sur la face interne de la joue, généralement en face de la deuxième molaire maxillaire.

La papille parotide est une petite élévation de tissu qui marque l'ouverture du canal parotidien sur la surface interne de la joue. La glande a quatre surfaces - superficielle ou latérale, supérieure, antéro-médiale et postéro-médiale.

La glande a trois bords - antérieur, médial et postérieur.

La glande parotide a deux extrémités - une extrémité supérieure sous la forme d'une petite surface supérieure et une extrémité inférieure (apex).

Un certain nombre de structures différentes traversent la glande.

De latéral à médial, ce sont :

Nerf facial
Veine rétromandibulaire
Artère carotide externe
Artère temporale superficielle
Branches du grand nerf auriculaire
Artère maxillaireParfois, les glandes parotides accessoires se présentent comme une variation anatomique.

Celles-ci sont proches des glandes principales et sont constituées de tissu de glande salivaire ectopique.

Capsule de la glande parotide

La capsule de la glande parotide est formée à partir de la couche d'investissement du fascia cervical profond. 

Il est alimenté par le grand nerf auriculaire. 

Le fascia se divise pour enfermer la glande. 

Cette division se produit entre l'angle de la mandibule et le processus mastoïdien. 

La lame superficielle (fascia parotidomassétrique) est épaisse et est attachée à l'arcade zygomatique. 

La lame profonde est mince et est attachée au processus styloïde, à la plaque tympanique et à la branche de la mandibule. 

La partie de la lame profonde s'étendant entre le processus styloïde et la mandibule est épaissie pour former le ligament stylomastoïdien. 

Le ligament stylo-mandibulaire sépare la glande parotide du lobe superficiel de la glande sous-maxillaire.


=== Emplacement ===

Relations superficielles ou latérales : 
La glande est située au plus profond de la peau, du fascia superficiel, de la lame superficielle de la couche d'investissement du fascia cervical profond et du grand nerf auriculaire (branche antérieure de C2 et C3).

Relations antéromédiales :
La glande est située en arrière des muscles ramus mandibulaire, masséter et ptérygoïdien médial.

Une partie de la glande peut s'étendre entre la branche rameuse et le ptérygoïde médial, comme le processus ptérygoïdien.

Des branches du nerf facial et du canal parotidien émergent à travers cette surface.

Relations postéromédiales :
 La glande est située antérolatéralement au processus mastoïde de l'os temporal avec ses muscles sternocléidomastoïdiens et digastriques attachés, le processus styloïde de l'os temporal avec ses trois muscles attachés (stylohyoïde, stylopharyngeus et styloglossus) et la gaine carotide avec sa neurovasculature contenue (artère carotide interne, artère interne veine jugulaire et 9e, 10e, 11e et 12e nerfs crâniens).

Relations médiales : 
 La glande parotide entre en contact avec le muscle constricteur pharyngé supérieur au niveau du bord médial, là où les surfaces antéro-médiale et postéro-médiale se rencontrent. 

Par conséquent, il existe un besoin d'examiner l'arrière-bouche dans la parotidite.


=== Approvisionnement en sang ===

L'artère carotide externe et ses branches terminales dans la glande, à savoir l'artère temporale superficielle et l'artère maxillaire, ainsi que l'artère auriculaire postérieure alimentent la glande parotide. 

Le retour veineux se fait vers les veines rétromandibulaires.


=== Drainage lymphatique ===

La glande est principalement drainée dans les ganglions lymphatiques préauriculaires ou parotidiens qui se drainent finalement vers la chaîne cervicale profonde.


=== Innervation ===

La glande parotide reçoit à la fois l'innervation sensorielle et autonome. 

L'innervation sensorielle générale de la glande parotide, de sa gaine et de la peau sus-jacente est assurée par le nerf auriculotemporal. 

L'innervation autonome contrôle le taux de production de salive et est alimentée par le nerf glossopharyngien.

Les corps cellulaires des fibres sympathiques préganglionnaires se trouvent généralement dans les cornes latérales des segments vertébraux thoraciques supérieurs (T1-T3). 

Les fibres sympathiques postganglionnaires du ganglion sympathique cervical supérieur atteignent la glande sous forme de plexus nerveux périartériels autour de l'artère carotide externe et leur fonction est principalement la vasoconstriction. 

Les fibres parasympathiques préganglionnaires quittent le tronc cérébral à partir du noyau salivaire inférieur dans le nerf glossopharyngé, puis à travers son tympanique, puis la branche pétreuse inférieure, passent dans le ganglion otique.

Là, ils font synapse avec des fibres postganglionnaires qui atteignent la glande en faisant de l'auto-stop via le nerf auriculotemporal, une branche du nerf mandibulaire. : 255 


=== Histologie ===


La glande a sa propre capsule de tissu conjonctif dense, mais est également pourvue d'une fausse capsule par la couche d'investissement du fascia cervical profond.

Le fascia à la ligne imaginaire entre l'angle de la mandibule et le processus mastoïdien se divise en une lame superficielle et une lame profonde pour enfermer la glande.

Le risorius est un petit muscle intégré à cette substance de la capsule.
La glande a des canaux courts et striés et de longs canaux intercalés.

Les canaux intercalés sont également nombreux et tapissés de cellules épithéliales cuboïdes, et ont des lumières plus grandes que celles des acini. 

Les canaux striés sont également nombreux et consistent en un épithélium cylindrique simple, ayant des stries qui représentent les membranes cellulaires basales repliées et les mitochondries.

Bien que la glande parotide soit la plus grande, elle ne fournit que 25 % du volume salivaire total. 

La cellule séreuse prédomine dans la parotide, ce qui fait que la glande sécrète un produit sécrétoire principalement séreux.

La glande parotide sécrète également l'alpha-amylase salivaire (sAA), qui est la première étape de la décomposition des amidons lors de la mastication. 

C'est la principale glande exocrine à sécréter cela. 

Il décompose l'amylose (amidon à chaîne droite) et l'amylopectine (amidon ramifié) en hydrolysant les liaisons alpha 1,4. 

De plus, l'alpha-amylase a été suggérée pour empêcher la fixation bactérienne aux surfaces buccales et pour permettre l'élimination bactérienne de la bouche.


== Développement ==

Les glandes salivaires parotides apparaissent au début de la sixième semaine du développement prénatal et sont les premières glandes salivaires majeures formées.

Les bourgeons épithéliaux de ces glandes sont situés sur la partie interne de la joue, près des commissures labiales de la bouche primitive (à partir de la muqueuse ectodermique près des angles du stomodeum dans les 1er/2e arcs pharyngiens ; le stomodeum lui-même est créé à partir de la rupture de la membrane oropharyngée à environ 26 jours.)

Ces bourgeons poussent vers l'arrière vers les placodes otiques des oreilles et se ramifient pour former des cordons solides avec des extrémités terminales arrondies près du nerf facial en développement.

Plus tard, à environ 10 semaines de développement prénatal, ces cordons sont canalisés et forment des canaux, le plus grand devenant le canal parotidien de la glande parotide. 

Les extrémités terminales arrondies des cordons forment les acini des glandes. 

La sécrétion par les glandes parotides via le canal parotidien commence à environ 18 semaines de gestation. 

Encore une fois, le tissu conjonctif de soutien de la glande se développe à partir du mésenchyme environnant.


== Gonflement des glandes parotides ==

=== causes ===

==== Oreillons ====

Les oreillons sont considérés comme une cause fréquente de gonflement de la glande parotide - 85% des cas surviennent chez les enfants de moins de 15 ans. 

La maladie est très contagieuse et se propage par des gouttelettes en suspension dans l'air provenant des sécrétions salivaires, nasales et urinaires. 

Les symptômes comprennent un œdème dans la région, un trismus ainsi qu'une otalgie. 

La lésion a tendance à débuter d'un côté du visage et finit par devenir bilatérale. 

La transmission du paramyxovirus se fait par contact avec la salive des personnes infectées. 

Les premiers symptômes ont tendance à être un mal de tête et de la fièvre. 

Les oreillons ne sont pas mortels, mais d'autres complications peuvent inclure un gonflement des ovaires ou des testicules. 

Le diagnostic d'oreillons est confirmé par la sérologie virale, la prise en charge de l'affection passe par une hydratation et une bonne hygiène bucco-dentaire du patient nécessitant une excellente motivation. 

Cependant, depuis le développement du vaccin contre les oreillons, administré entre 4 et 6 ans, l'incidence de cette infection virale a fortement diminué. 

Ce vaccin a réduit l'incidence de 99 %.


==== Tumeurs ====

===== bénin =====

Les lésions néoplasiques de la glande salivaire parotide peuvent être bénignes ou malignes. 

Au sein de la glande parotide, près de 80 % des tumeurs sont bénignes. 

Les lésions bénignes ont tendance à être indolores, asymptomatiques et à croissance lente. 

Les tumeurs des glandes salivaires les plus courantes chez les enfants sont les hémangiomes, les malformations lymphatiques et les adénomes pléomorphes. 

Le diagnostic des lésions bénignes nécessite une biopsie par aspiration en forme d'aiguille fine. 

Avec diverses lésions bénignes, le plus souvent l'adénome pléomorphe, il existe un risque de développer une malignité avec le temps. 

En conséquence, ces lésions sont généralement réséquées.

L'adénome pléomorphe est considéré comme une tumeur bénigne commune de la glande salivaire et a une incidence globale de 54 à 68 %. 

La tumeur de Warthin a une incidence plus faible de 6 à 10 % ; cette tumeur est associée au tabagisme et est plus fréquente chez les hommes âgés.

Les lésions bénignes de la glande parotide ont une incidence significativement plus élevée que les lésions malignes.


===== Malin =====

Les lésions malignes des glandes salivaires sont rares. 

Cependant, lorsqu'une tumeur s'étend aux glandes sous-maxillaires, sublinguales et salivaires mineures, elles ont tendance à être malignes. 

Distinguer une lésion maligne d'une lésion bénigne peut être difficile car ils se présentent tous les deux comme des lésions indolores. 

Une biopsie est cruciale pour aider au diagnostic. 

Il existe des signes communs qui peuvent mettre en évidence la présence d'une lésion maligne. 

Ceux-ci comprennent une faiblesse du nerf facial, une augmentation rapide de la taille de la masse ainsi qu'une ulcération de la muqueuse de la peau.

Le carcinome mucoépidermoïde est une tumeur maligne courante des glandes salivaires et a une faible incidence de 4 à 13 %. 

Le carcinome adénoïde kystique est également une lésion maligne courante des glandes salivaires et a une incidence de 4 à 8 %. 

Ce carcinome a tendance à envahir les nerfs et peut réapparaître après le traitement.


==== Maladie polykystique de la parotide ====

Une maladie polykystique développementale de la glande salivaire est considérée comme extrêmement rare et indépendante de la parotidite récurrente.

On pense que la cause est un défaut dans les interactions entre l'activine, la follistatine et le TGF-β, conduisant à un trouble du développement du tissu glandulaire.


== Signification clinique ==

=== Parotidite ===

L'inflammation d'une ou des deux glandes parotides est connue sous le nom de parotidite.

La cause la plus fréquente de parotidite est les oreillons.

La vaccination généralisée contre les oreillons a considérablement réduit l'incidence de la parotidite ourlienne.

La douleur des oreillons est due au gonflement de la glande à l'intérieur de sa capsule fibreuse.

Outre l'infection virale, d'autres infections, telles que bactériennes, peuvent provoquer une parotidite (parotidite aiguë suppurée ou parotidite chronique).

Ces infections peuvent provoquer un blocage du canal par des calculs du canal salivaire ou une compression externe.

Les gonflements de la glande parotide peuvent également être dus à des lésions lymphoépithéliales bénignes causées par la maladie de Mikulicz et le syndrome de Sjögren.

Le gonflement de la glande parotide peut également indiquer le trouble de l'alimentation boulimie nerveuse, créant l'apparence d'une ligne de mâchoire lourde.

Avec l'inflammation des oreillons ou l'obstruction des canaux, des niveaux accrus d'alpha-amylase salivaire sécrétée par la glande parotide peuvent être détectés dans la circulation sanguine.


=== Réactions fibreuses ===

La tuberculose et la syphilis peuvent provoquer la formation de granulomes dans les glandes parotides.


=== Calculs salivaires ===

Les calculs salivaires se produisent principalement dans la confluence principale des canaux et dans le canal parotidien principal.

Le patient se plaint généralement de douleurs intenses lorsqu'il salive et a tendance à éviter les aliments qui produisent ce symptôme.

De plus, la glande parotide peut grossir en essayant de manger.

La douleur peut être reproduite en clinique en faisant gicler du jus de citron dans la bouche.

La chirurgie dépend du site de la pierre : si dans la face antérieure du conduit, une simple incision dans la muqueuse buccale avec sphinterotomie peut permettre le retrait ; cependant, s'il est situé plus en arrière dans le conduit principal, une excision complète de la glande peut être nécessaire.


=== Blessure ===

La glande salivaire parotide peut également être percée et le nerf facial temporairement traumatisé lorsqu'un bloc nerveux d'anesthésie locale alvéolaire inférieur est mal administré, provoquant une paralysie faciale transitoire.


=== Cancer et tumeurs ===

Environ 80 % des tumeurs de la glande parotide sont bénignes.

Les plus courants d'entre eux comprennent l'adénome pléomorphe (70 % des tumeurs, dont 60 % surviennent chez les femmes) et la tumeur de Warthin (c'est-à-dire l'adénolymphome, qui est plus fréquent chez les hommes que chez les femmes).

Leur importance est liée à leur position anatomique et à leur tendance à grossir avec le temps.

La croissance tumorale peut également modifier la consistance de la glande et provoquer des douleurs faciales du côté concerné.

Environ 20 % des tumeurs parotidiennes sont malignes, les tumeurs les plus courantes étant le carcinome mucoépidermoïde et le carcinome adénoïde kystique.

D'autres tumeurs malignes de la glande parotide comprennent le carcinome à cellules acineuses, l'adénome expléomorphe carcinome, l'adénocarcinome (provenant de l'épithélium canalaire de la glande parotide), le carcinome épidermoïde (provenant du parenchyme de la glande parotide) et le carcinome indifférencié.

Des métastases provenant d'autres sites comme la tumeur phyllode du sein se présentant comme un gonflement parotidien ont également été décrites.

De manière critique, la relation entre la tumeur et les branches du nerf facial (CN VII) doit être définie car la résection peut endommager les nerfs, entraînant une paralysie des muscles de l'expression faciale.


=== Chirurgie ===

Le traitement chirurgical des tumeurs de la glande parotide est parfois difficile en raison des relations anatomiques de la loge parotide du nerf facial, ainsi que du risque accru de rechute postopératoire. 

Ainsi, la détection des stades précoces d'une tumeur parotide est extrêmement importante en termes de pronostic postopératoire. 

La technique opératoire est laborieuse, du fait des rechutes et des traitements antérieurs incomplets réalisés dans d'autres spécialités frontalières. 

Les techniques chirurgicales en chirurgie parotidienne ont évolué ces dernières années avec l'utilisation du neuromonitoring du nerf facial et sont devenues plus sûres et moins invasives.

Après l'ablation chirurgicale de la glande parotide (parotidectomie), le nerf auriculotemporal est susceptible d'être endommagé et lors de la récupération, il fusionne avec les glandes sudoripares. 

Cela peut provoquer une transpiration sur la joue du côté du visage de la glande affectée. 

Cette condition est connue sous le nom de syndrome de Frey.


== Infections ==

=== Infections bactériennes ===

==== Parotidite bactérienne aiguë ====

Généralement causée par une infection bactérienne rétrograde à la suite d'une maladie, d'une septicémie, d'un traumatisme, d'une intervention chirurgicale, d'une réduction du flux salivaire due à des médicaments, du diabète, de la malnutrition et de la déshydratation. 

Symptômes classiquement de gonflement douloureux dans la région parotide en mangeant vu. 

La prise en charge est basée sur les antibactériens, la réhydratation associée à un massage doux pour favoriser le flux salivaire.


==== Parotidite bactérienne chronique ====

Une infection latente malgré la résolution clinique de la maladie entraînant une altération de la fonction.

Une dilatation histologique des canaux glandulaires, une formation d'abcès et une atrophie peuvent être observées.

Les sécrétions parotidiennes sont visqueuses.

L'évolution de la maladie montre la douleur et l'enflure, la croissance et le déclin.

Un dépistage radiographique doit être entrepris pour exclure le sialolithe.

Prise en charge en soins palliatifs avec parotidectomie en dernier recours.



=== Infections virales ===

==== Oreillons ====

Maladie aiguë non suppurée qui survient souvent en épidémie.

Prévenu par le vaccin ROR.

Causée par un paramyxovirus transmis par la salive et l'urine infectées.

Une période prodromique de 24 à 28 heures est observée, suivie d'un gonflement rapide et douloureux de la glande parotide.

Le traitement est de soutien (alitement, hydratation) car la résolution spontanée se produit dans les 5 à 10 jours.


==== VIH/SIDA ====

Une hypertrophie diffuse des glandes est observée et peut affecter les patients à tous les stades de l'infection. 

Les kystes lymphoépithéliaux vus par imagerie aident au diagnostic. 

Le processus pathogène se produit en raison de la circulation des lymphocytes CD8 dans la glande salivaire. 

Prise en charge médicale via l'utilisation d'antirétroviraux, d'excellentes mesures d'hygiène bucco-dentaire et de sialogogues.


=== Lié à l'auto-immunité ===

==== Lupus érythémateux disséminé ====

Le plus souvent vu dans les quatrième et cinquième décennies chez les femmes, et peut affecter n'importe quelle glande salivaire. 

La présentation est une glande qui s'agrandit lentement, avec un diagnostic établi par l'identification du trouble systémique sous-jacent et des mesures des niveaux chimiques salivaires. 

Les niveaux d'ions sodium et chlorure seront élevés deux ou trois fois les niveaux normaux. 

Le traitement consiste à traiter la condition systémique sous-jacente.


==== Sarcoïdose ====

La sarcoïdose est une maladie systémique chronique caractérisée par la production de granulomes non caséeux d'étiologie inconnue.

Il peut affecter n'importe quel organe du corps, déprimant l'immunité cellulaire et renforçant l'immunité humorale.

L'atteinte des glandes salivaires implique principalement la glande parotide, provoquant une hypertrophie et un gonflement.

Une biopsie des glandes salivaires avec examen histopathologique est nécessaire pour faire la distinction entre le syndrome de Sjoren ou la sarcoïdose en est la cause.


==== Syndrome de Sjogren ====

L'hypertrophie des glandes salivaires survient chez jusqu'à 30% des patients atteints du syndrome de Sjogren, la glande parotide étant le plus souvent hypertrophiée et l'hypertrophie bilatérale de la glande parotide observée chez 25 à 60% des patients.

Cependant, les glandes parotides ont une capacité sécrétoire plus durable chez le patient atteint du syndrome de Sjogren et sont donc les dernières glandes à manifester une hyposalivation dans la maladie.

L'histopathologie montre un regroupement d'infiltrats lymphocytaires et d'îlots épimyoépithéliaux.


=== Infection mycobactérienne ===


La manifestation la plus courante de la tête et du cou de la mycobactériose tuberculeuse est l'infection des ganglions lymphatiques cervicaux.

On pense que l'infection provient des amygdales ou de la gencive, remontant jusqu'à la glande parotide.

Deux formes cliniques ; lésions aiguës et chroniques.

Les lésions aiguës présentent un œdème glandulaire diffus, facilement confondu avec une sialdentite aiguë ou un abcès.

Les lésions chroniques se présentent sous la forme de masses à croissance lente imitant les tumeurs.


== Examen de la glande salivaire ==



=== Histoire et examen ===

Un patient présentant une tuméfaction parotidienne peut se plaindre de tuméfaction, de douleur, de xérostomie, de mauvais goût et parfois de sialorrhée.

Le symptôme de présentation le plus courant des néoplasmes (bénins et malins) est un gonflement asymptomatique.

La douleur est plus fréquente chez les patients atteints d'un cancer de la parotide (10 à 29 % ressentent de la douleur) que chez ceux atteints de tumeurs bénignes (seulement 2,5 à 4 %), mais la douleur elle-même n'est pas un diagnostic de malignité.

Un gonflement épisodique des principales glandes salivaires accompagné de douleur et lié à des stimuli salivaires suggère une obstruction des canaux.

Aussi besoin d'évaluer le nerf facial.

Le nerf facial traverse la parotide et peut donc être affecté en cas de modification de la glande parotide.

La paralysie du nerf facial chez un patient non traité auparavant indique généralement qu'une tumeur est maligne.


=== Examen physique ===

La localisation superficielle des glandes salivaires permet la palpation et l'inspection visuelle. 

L'inspection doit être systématique, tant intra-buccale qu'extra-buccale, afin qu'aucune zone ne soit oubliée.

Pour l'examen extra-oral, la tête du patient doit être inclinée vers l'avant afin d'exposer au maximum les glandes parotides et sous-maxillaires. 

Une glande parotide normale est à peine palpable et une glande sublinguale normale n'est pas palpable. L'examen intra-oral doit inclure des observations d'asymétrie, de décoloration, de pulsation et d'obstructions dans les orifices des conduits. 

Un gonflement du lobe profond de la glande parotide peut être observé par voie intra-orale et peut également déplacer l'amygdale. 

Les glandes salivaires mineures doivent être examinées. 

La muqueuse labiale, buccale et palatine postérieure doit être séchée à l'aide d'un souffleur d'air ou d'un tissu et pressée pour évaluer le flux de salive.


=== Test salivaire ===

Stimulation salivaire

Cela peut être fait en palpant la glande parotide, la stimulant ainsi.

Évaluer pour voir s'il y a de la salive qui s'écoule de la papille parotide. Sialographie

Les sialogrammes peuvent identifier les changements dans l'architecture des glandes salivaires et sont utiles dans l'évaluation des gonflements majeurs des glandes.

Elle implique l'instillation d'un liquide radio-opaque dans le système canalaire de la glande majeure.

Cela décrit les systèmes canalaires majeurs et mineurs, et donne également un aperçu du tissu glandulaire.

Par exemple, la sialadénite crée une apparence connue sous le nom de "taille de l'arbre" sur un sialogramme, où il y a moins de branches visibles depuis le système de conduits.

En outre, une lésion occupant de l'espace qui se produit à l'intérieur ou à côté d'une glande salivaire peut déplacer l'anatomie normale de la glande.

Cela peut créer une apparence connue sous le nom de "boule dans la main" sur un sialogramme, où les conduits sont courbés autour de la masse de la lésion.Sialochimie

La composition de la salive change dans les états pathologiques et l'analyse de la salive pour les enzymes, les électrolytes, les hormones, les médicaments et le statut vaccinal peut être effectuée. Scintigraphie aux radio-isotopes 

Donne une mesure objective de l'absorption et de l'excrétion des isotopes à l'aide d'une caméra à scintillation gamma. 

Après environ 20 minutes, un stimulant salivaire sera administré pour favoriser le flux salivaire à travers la glande. 

Ils sont utilisés pour évaluer les patients présentant des symptômes persistants de bouche sèche et également pour évaluer le gonflement des glandes salivaires dû à une infection, une inflammation ou une obstruction.


=== D'autres tests ===

-Techniques d'imagination

-Les ultrasons, les tomodensitogrammes ou les IRM peuvent aider à localiser la maladie

-Sialoendoscopie

-Une caméra est insérée dans le conduit d'une glande salivaire pour évaluer les blocages

-Biopsie

-Cela peut être fait par biopsie par aspiration à l'aiguille fine, ce qui permet d'obtenir des informations sur l'histologie d'une tumeur salivaire avant le début du traitement.

GLÂNDULA PARÓTIDA


A glândula parótida é a principal glândula salivar em muitos animais. 

Nos humanos, as duas glândulas parótidas estão presentes em ambos os lados da boca e na frente de ambas as orelhas. 

São as maiores das glândulas salivares. 

Cada parótida é enrolada ao redor do ramo mandibular e secreta saliva serosa através do ducto parotídeo na boca, para facilitar a mastigação e deglutição e para iniciar a digestão dos amidos. 

Existem também dois outros tipos de glândulas salivares; são glândulas submandibulares e sublinguais.

Às vezes, as glândulas parótidas acessórias são encontradas próximas às glândulas parótidas principais.


== Etimologia ==

A palavra parotid significa literalmente "ao lado da orelha". 

Do grego παρωτίς (radical παρωτιδ-): (glândula) atrás da orelha < παρά - pará: na frente, e οὖς - ous (radical ὠτ-, ōt-): orelha.


== Estrutura ==

As glândulas parótidas são um par de glândulas salivares principalmente serosas localizadas abaixo e na frente de cada canal auditivo, drenando suas secreções para o vestíbulo da boca através do ducto parotídeo. 

Cada glândula situa-se atrás do ramo mandibular e na frente do processo mastóide do osso temporal. 

A glândula pode ser sentida em ambos os lados, sentindo-se na frente de cada orelha, ao longo da bochecha e abaixo do ângulo da mandíbula.

O ducto parotídeo, um longo ducto excretor, emerge da frente de cada glândula, superficialmente ao músculo masseter. 

O ducto perfura o músculo bucinador, depois se abre na boca na superfície interna da bochecha, geralmente oposta ao segundo molar superior. 

A papila parotídea é uma pequena elevação de tecido que marca a abertura do ducto parotídeo na superfície interna da bochecha. A glândula tem quatro superfícies – superficial ou lateral, superior, anteromedial e posteromedial. 

A glândula tem três bordas – anterior, medial e posterior. 

A glândula parótida tem duas extremidades – extremidade superior em forma de pequena superfície superior e uma extremidade inferior (ápice). 

Várias estruturas diferentes passam pela glândula. 

De lateral para medial, são:

Nervo facial
Veia retromandibular
Artéria carótida externa
Artéria temporal superficial
Ramos do grande nervo auricular
Artéria maxilar Às vezes, as glândulas parótidas acessórias são encontradas como uma variação anatômica. 

Estas estão próximas às glândulas principais e consistem em tecido de glândula salivar ectópica.

Cápsula da glândula parótida

A cápsula da glândula parótida é formada a partir da camada de revestimento da fáscia cervical profunda.

É suprido pelo grande nervo auricular.

A fáscia se divide para envolver a glândula.

Essa divisão ocorre entre o ângulo da mandíbula e o processo mastóide.

A lâmina superficial (fáscia parotidomassétrica) é espessa e está inserida no arco zigomático.

A lâmina profunda é fina e está ligada ao processo estilóide, à lâmina timpânica e ao ramo da mandíbula.

A parte da lâmina profunda que se estende entre o processo estilóide e a mandíbula é espessada para formar o ligamento estilomastóideo.

O ligamento estilomandibular separa a glândula parótida do lobo superficial da glândula submandibular.


=== Localização ===

Relações superficiais ou laterais:
 A glândula está situada profundamente à pele, fáscia superficial, lâmina superficial da camada de revestimento da fáscia cervical profunda e nervo auricular grande (ramo anterior de C2 e C3).

Relações anteromediais: 
 A glândula está situada posterolateralmente aos músculos do ramo mandibular, masseter e pterigóideo medial. 

Uma parte da glândula pode se estender entre o ramo e o pterigóide medial, como o processo pterigóide. 

Ramos do nervo facial e do ducto parotídeo emergem através desta superfície.

Relações póstero-mediais: 
A glândula está situada anterolateralmente ao processo mastóide do osso temporal com seus músculos esternocleidomastóideo e digástrico inseridos, processo estiloide do osso temporal com seus três músculos fixados (estilo-hióideo, estilofaríngeo e estiloglosso) e bainha carotídea com sua neurovasculatura contida (artéria carótida interna, veia jugular e 9º, 10º, 11º e 12º nervos cranianos).

Relações mediais:
A glândula parótida entra em contato com o músculo constritor superior da faringe na borda medial, onde as superfícies anteromedial e posteromedial se encontram.

Portanto, existe a necessidade de examinar as fauces na parotidite.


=== Suprimento sanguíneo ===

A artéria carótida externa e seus ramos terminais dentro da glândula, ou seja, a artéria temporal superficial e a artéria maxilar, também a artéria auricular posterior suprem a glândula parótida.

O retorno venoso é para as veias retromandibulares.


=== Drenagem linfática ===

A glândula é drenada principalmente para os linfonodos pré-auriculares ou parotídeos que, por fim, drenam para a cadeia cervical profunda.


=== Suprimento nervoso ===

A glândula parótida recebe inervação sensorial e autonômica. 

A inervação sensitiva geral para a glândula parótida, sua bainha e a pele sobrejacente é fornecida pelo nervo auriculotemporal. 

A inervação autonômica controla a taxa de produção de saliva e é suprida pelo nervo glossofaríngeo.

Os corpos celulares das fibras simpáticas pré-ganglionares geralmente se encontram nos cornos laterais dos segmentos espinais torácicos superiores (T1-T3). 

As fibras simpáticas pós-ganglionares do gânglio simpático cervical superior atingem a glândula como plexos nervosos periarteriais ao redor da artéria carótida externa e sua função é principalmente a vasoconstrição. 

As fibras parassimpáticas pré-ganglionares deixam o tronco encefálico a partir do núcleo salivatório inferior no nervo glossofaríngeo e, em seguida, através de seu ramo timpânico e, em seguida, do ramo petroso menor, passam para o gânglio ótico.

Lá, eles fazem sinapse com fibras pós-ganglionares que chegam à glândula pedindo carona através do nervo auriculotemporal, um ramo do nervo mandibular.: 255 


=== Histologia ===


A glândula tem uma cápsula própria de tecido conjuntivo denso, mas também é provida de uma falsa cápsula pela camada de revestimento da fáscia cervical profunda.

A fáscia na linha imaginária entre o ângulo da mandíbula e o processo mastóide se divide em uma lâmina superficial e uma lâmina profunda para envolver a glândula.

O risório é um pequeno músculo embutido nesta substância da cápsula.
A glândula tem ductos curtos e estriados e ductos longos e intercalados.

Os ductos intercalares também são numerosos e revestidos por células epiteliais cuboidais, e possuem lúmens maiores que os dos ácinos.

Os ductos estriados também são numerosos e consistem em epitélio colunar simples, possuindo estrias que representam as membranas celulares basais dobradas e as mitocôndrias.

Embora a glândula parótida seja a maior, ela fornece apenas 25% do volume salivar total.

A célula serosa predomina na parótida, fazendo com que a glândula secrete um produto de secreção principalmente seroso.

A glândula parótida também secreta alfa-amilase salivar (sAA), que é o primeiro passo na decomposição de amidos durante a mastigação.

É a principal glândula exócrina a secretar isso.

Ele quebra a amilose (amido de cadeia reta) e amilopectina (amido ramificado) hidrolisando as ligações alfa 1,4.

Além disso, a alfa-amilase foi sugerida para prevenir a adesão bacteriana às superfícies orais e permitir a eliminação bacteriana da boca.


== Desenvolvimento ==

As glândulas salivares parótidas aparecem no início da sexta semana do desenvolvimento pré-natal e são as primeiras glândulas salivares maiores formadas.

Os brotos epiteliais dessas glândulas estão localizados na parte interna da bochecha, perto das comissuras labiais da boca primitiva (do revestimento ectodérmico próximo aos ângulos do estomodeu no 1º/2º arcos faríngeos; o próprio estomodeu é criado a partir da ruptura do a membrana orofaríngea em cerca de 26 dias.)

Esses brotos crescem posteriormente em direção aos placódios óticos das orelhas e se ramificam para formar cordões sólidos com extremidades terminais arredondadas perto do nervo facial em desenvolvimento.

Mais tarde, por volta das 10 semanas de desenvolvimento pré-natal, esses cordões são canalizados e formam ductos, sendo o maior o ducto parotídeo para a glândula parótida. 

As extremidades arredondadas dos cordões formam os ácinos das glândulas. 

A secreção pelas glândulas parótidas através do ducto parotídeo começa por volta das 18 semanas de gestação. 

Novamente, o tecido conjuntivo de sustentação da glândula se desenvolve a partir do mesênquima circundante.


== Inchaço da glândula parótida ==

=== Causas ===

==== Caxumba ====

A caxumba é vista como uma causa comum de inchaço da glândula parótida – 85% dos casos ocorrem em crianças menores de 15 anos. 

A doença é altamente contagiosa e se espalha por gotículas no ar das secreções salivares, nasais e urinárias. 

Os sintomas incluem edema na área, trismo e otalgia. 

A lesão tende a começar em um lado da face e, eventualmente, torna-se bilateral. 

A transmissão do paramixovírus se dá pelo contato com a saliva da pessoa infectada. 

Os sintomas iniciais tendem a ser dor de cabeça e febre. 

A caxumba não é fatal, no entanto, outras complicações podem incluir inchaço dos ovários ou testículos. 

O diagnóstico da caxumba é confirmado através da sorologia viral, o manejo da condição inclui hidratação e boa higiene bucal do paciente exigindo excelente motivação. 

No entanto, desde o desenvolvimento da vacina contra a caxumba, administrada na idade de 4 a 6 anos, a incidência dessa infecção viral diminuiu bastante. 

Esta vacina reduziu a incidência em 99%.


==== Neoplasias ====

===== Benigno =====

As lesões neoplásicas da glândula salivar parótida podem ser benignas ou malignas. 

Dentro da glândula parótida, quase 80% dos tumores são benignos. 

As lesões benignas tendem a ser indolores, assintomáticas e de crescimento lento. 

As neoplasias de glândulas salivares mais comuns em crianças são hemangiomas, malformações linfáticas e adenomas pleomórficos.

O diagnóstico de lesões benignas requer uma biópsia aspirativa tipo agulha fina.

Com várias lesões benignas, mais comumente o adenoma pleomórfico, existe o risco de desenvolver malignidade ao longo do tempo.

Como resultado, essas lesões são tipicamente ressecadas.

O adenoma pleomórfico é visto como uma neoplasia benigna comum da glândula salivar e tem uma incidência geral de 54-68%.

O tumor de Warthin tem menor incidência de 6-10%; este tumor está associado ao tabagismo e é mais comum em homens mais velhos.

As lesões benignas da glândula parótida têm uma incidência significativamente maior do que as lesões malignas.


===== Maligno =====

As lesões malignas das glândulas salivares são raras.

No entanto, quando um tumor se estende para as glândulas submandibulares, sublinguais e salivares menores, eles tendem a ser malignos. 

Distinguir uma lesão maligna de uma benigna pode ser difícil, pois ambas se apresentam como lesões indolores. 

A biópsia é crucial para auxiliar no diagnóstico. 

Existem sinais comuns que podem evidenciar a presença de uma lesão maligna. 

Estes incluem fraqueza do nervo facial, aumento rápido do tamanho do nódulo, bem como ulceração da mucosa da pele.

O carcinoma mucoepidermóide é um tumor maligno comum das glândulas salivares e tem uma baixa incidência de 4-13%. 

O carcinoma adenóide cístico também é uma lesão maligna comum das glândulas salivares e tem uma incidência de 4 a 8%. 

Este carcinoma tende a invadir os nervos e pode ocorrer novamente após o tratamento.


==== Doença Policística da Parótida ====

Uma doença policística do desenvolvimento da glândula salivar é considerada extremamente rara e independente de parotidite recorrente.

Acredita-se que a causa seja um defeito nas interações entre a activina, folistatina e TGF-β, levando a um distúrbio de desenvolvimento do tecido glandular.


== Significado clínico ==

=== Parotidite ===

A inflamação de uma ou ambas as glândulas parótidas é conhecida como parotidite.

A causa mais comum de parotidite é a caxumba.

A vacinação generalizada contra a caxumba reduziu marcadamente a incidência de parotidite por caxumba.

A dor da caxumba é devido ao inchaço da glândula dentro de sua cápsula fibrosa.

Além da infecção viral, outras infecções, como as bacterianas, podem causar parotidite (parotidite supurativa aguda ou parotidite crônica).

Essas infecções podem causar bloqueio do ducto por cálculos do ducto salivar ou compressão externa.

O inchaço da glândula parótida também pode ser devido a lesões linfoepiteliais benignas causadas pela doença de Mikulicz e síndrome de Sjögren.

O inchaço da glândula parótida também pode indicar o transtorno alimentar bulimia nervosa, criando a aparência de uma linha de mandíbula pesada.

Com a inflamação da caxumba ou obstrução dos ductos, níveis aumentados da alfa amilase salivar secretada pela glândula parótida podem ser detectados na corrente sanguínea.


=== Reações fibrosas ===

A tuberculose e a sífilis podem causar a formação de granulomas nas glândulas parótidas.


=== Pedras salivares ===

Os cálculos salivares ocorrem principalmente na confluência principal dos ductos e no ducto parotídeo principal.

O paciente geralmente se queixa de dor intensa ao salivar e tende a evitar alimentos que produzam esse sintoma.

Além disso, a glândula parótida pode aumentar de tamanho ao tentar comer.

A dor pode ser reproduzida na clínica esguichando suco de limão na boca.

A cirurgia depende do local do cálculo: se estiver na face anterior do ducto, uma simples incisão na mucosa bucal com esfinterotomia pode permitir a remoção; entretanto, se situado mais posteriormente dentro do ducto principal, pode ser necessária a excisão completa da glândula.


=== Lesão ===

A glândula salivar parótida também pode ser perfurada e o nervo facial traumatizado temporariamente quando um bloqueio do nervo local alveolar inferior é administrado incorretamente, causando paralisia facial transitória.


=== Câncer e tumores ===

Cerca de 80% dos tumores da glândula parótida são benignos.

Os mais comuns incluem adenoma pleomórfico (70% dos tumores, dos quais 60% ocorrem em mulheres) e tumor de Warthin (ou seja, adenolinfoma, que é mais comum em homens do que em mulheres).

Sua importância está em relação à sua posição anatômica e tendência de crescimento ao longo do tempo.

O crescimento tumoral também pode alterar a consistência da glândula e causar dor facial no lado envolvido.

Cerca de 20% dos tumores de parótida são malignos, sendo os tumores mais comuns o carcinoma mucoepidermóide e o carcinoma adenoide cístico.

Outros tumores malignos da glândula parótida incluem carcinoma de células acinares, carcinoma de adenoma expleomórfico, adenocarcinoma (decorrente do epitélio ductal da glândula parótida), carcinoma de células escamosas (decorrente do parênquima da glândula parótida) e carcinoma indiferenciado.

Metástases de outros locais como tumor filodes da mama apresentando-se como edema de parótida também foram descritas.

Criticamente, a relação do tumor com os ramos do nervo facial (NC VII) deve ser definida, pois a ressecção pode danificar os nervos, resultando em paralisia dos músculos da expressão facial.


=== Cirurgia ===

O tratamento cirúrgico dos tumores da glândula parótida às vezes é difícil devido às relações anatômicas da loja da parótida do nervo facial, bem como ao aumento do potencial de recidiva pós-operatória.

Assim, a detecção de estágios iniciais de um tumor de parótida é extremamente importante em termos de prognóstico pós-operatório.

A técnica operatória é trabalhosa, devido a recidivas e tratamento prévio incompleto feito em outras especialidades de fronteira.

As técnicas cirúrgicas em cirurgia de parótida evoluíram nos últimos anos com o uso do neuromonitoramento do nervo facial e tornaram-se mais seguras e menos invasivas.

Após a remoção cirúrgica da glândula parótida (Parotidectomia), o nervo auriculotemporal é suscetível a danos e, após a recuperação, funde-se com as glândulas sudoríparas. 

Isso pode causar sudorese na bochecha do lado da face da glândula afetada. 

Esta condição é conhecida como síndrome de Frey.


== Infecções ==

=== Infecções bacterianas ===

==== Parotidite bacteriana aguda ====

Comumente causada por uma infecção bacteriana retrógrada como resultado de doença, sepse, trauma, cirurgia, redução do fluxo salivar devido a medicamentos, diabetes, desnutrição e desidratação. 

Classicamente, os sintomas de inchaço doloroso na região da parótida ao comer são vistos. 

O manejo é baseado em antibacterianos, reidratação combinada com massagem suave para estimular o fluxo salivar.


==== Parotidite bacteriana crônica ====

Uma infecção latente apesar da resolução clínica da doença, resultando em função prejudicada. 

Histologicamente dilatação do ducto glandular, formação de abscesso e atrofia podem ser observados. 

As secreções das parótidas são viscosas. 

O curso da doença mostra dor e inchaço, aumentando e diminuindo. 

A triagem radiográfica deve ser realizada para descartar sialolito. 

Manejo com cuidados paliativos com parotidectomia como último recurso.



=== Infecções virais ===

==== Caxumba ====

Doença aguda não supurativa que ocorre frequentemente em epidemias. 

Prevenido pela vacina MMR. 

Causada pelo paramixovírus que é transmitido pela saliva e urina infectadas. 

Ocorre um período prodrômico de 24 a 28 horas, seguido de edema rápido e doloroso da glândula parótida. 

O tratamento é de suporte (repouso no leito, hidratação), pois a resolução espontânea ocorre dentro de 5 a 10 dias.


==== HIV/AIDS ====

O aumento difuso da glândula é visto e pode afetar os pacientes em todos os estágios da infecção. 

Os cistos linfoepiteliais vistos por imagem ajudam no diagnóstico.

O processo patogênico ocorre devido aos linfócitos CD8 circulantes dentro da glândula salivar.

Manejo médico através do uso de antirretrovirais, excelentes medidas de higiene bucal e sialogogos.


=== Relacionado autoimune ===

==== Lúpus eritematoso sistêmico ====

Mais comumente visto na quarta e quinta décadas em mulheres, podendo acometer qualquer glândula salivar.

A apresentação é uma glândula de crescimento lento, com diagnóstico feito pela identificação do distúrbio sistêmico subjacente e medições dos níveis químicos salivares.

Os níveis de íons de sódio e cloreto serão elevados duas ou três vezes os níveis normais.

O tratamento é abordando a condição sistêmica subjacente.


==== Sarcoidose ====

A sarcoidose é uma doença sistêmica crônica caracterizada pela produção de granulomas não caseosos de etiologia desconhecida.

Pode afetar qualquer órgão do corpo, deprimindo a imunidade celular e aumentando a imunidade humoral.

O envolvimento da glândula salivar envolve principalmente a glândula parótida, causando aumento e inchaço. 

A biópsia da glândula salivar com exame histopatológico é necessária para distinguir se a síndrome de Sjoren ou a sarcoidose são a causa disso.


==== Síndrome de Sjögren ====

O aumento da glândula salivar ocorre em até 30% dos pacientes com síndrome de Sjögren, sendo a glândula parótida mais frequentemente aumentada e o aumento bilateral da glândula parótida observado em 25-60% dos pacientes. 

No entanto, as glândulas parótidas têm uma capacidade secretora mais duradoura no paciente com síndrome de Sjögren e, portanto, são as últimas glândulas a manifestar hipossalivação na doença. 

A histopatologia mostra agrupamento de infiltrados linfocíticos e ilhas epimioepiteliais.


=== Infecção micobacteriana ===


A manifestação de cabeça e pescoço mais comum da tuberculose micobacteriana é a infecção dos linfonodos cervicais.

Acredita-se que a infecção se origine nas amígdalas ou gengiva, subindo para a glândula parótida.

Duas formas clínicas; lesões agudas e crônicas.

As lesões agudas apresentam edema glandular difuso, facilmente confundido com sialdentite aguda ou abscesso.

As lesões crônicas ocorrem como massas de crescimento lento simulando tumores.


== Exame da glândula salivar ==



=== História e exame ===

Um paciente com edema da parótida pode queixar-se de edema, dor, xerostomia, mau gosto e, às vezes, sialorréia.

O sintoma de apresentação mais comum de neoplasias (tanto benignas quanto malignas) é um inchaço assintomático.

A dor é mais comum em pacientes com câncer de parótida (10-29% sentem dor) do que aqueles com neoplasias benignas (apenas 2,5-4%), mas a dor em si não é diagnóstica de malignidade.

O edema episódico das glândulas salivares maiores acompanhado de dor e relacionado a estímulos salivares sugere obstrução do ducto.

Também precisa avaliar o nervo facial. 

O nervo facial passa pela parótida, portanto, pode ser afetado se houver uma alteração na glândula parótida. 

A paralisia do nervo facial em um paciente não tratado anteriormente geralmente indica que um tumor é maligno.


=== Exame físico ===

A localização superficial das glândulas salivares permite a palpação e inspeção visual. 

A inspeção deve ser sistemática, tanto intraoralmente quanto extraoralmente, para que nenhuma área seja perdida.

Para o exame extraoral, a cabeça do paciente deve ser inclinada para frente para expor ao máximo as glândulas parótidas e submandibulares.

Uma glândula parótida normal é pouco palpável e uma glândula sublingual normal não é palpável. O exame intra-oral deve incluir observações de assimetria, descoloração, pulsação e obstruções nos orifícios do ducto.

Inchaço do lobo profundo da glândula parótida pode ser visto intra-oralmente e também pode deslocar a amígdala.

As glândulas salivares menores devem ser examinadas.

A mucosa labial, bucal e palatina posterior deve ser seca com um soprador de ar ou tecido e pressionada para avaliar o fluxo de saliva.


=== Teste salivar ===

Estimulação salivar

Isso pode ser feito palpando a glândula parótida, estimulando-a.

Avalie para ver se há saliva fluindo da papila parotídea.Sialografia

Os sialogramas podem identificar alterações na arquitetura das glândulas salivares e são úteis na avaliação de grandes tumefações das glândulas.

Envolve a instilação de um fluido radiopaco no sistema ductal da glândula principal. 

Isso descreve os sistemas ductais maiores e menores, e também fornece um contorno do tecido glandular.

Por exemplo, a sialadenite cria uma aparência conhecida como “poda da árvore” em um sialograma, onde há menos galhos visíveis do sistema de dutos. 

Além disso, uma lesão ocupando espaço que ocorre dentro ou adjacente a uma glândula salivar pode deslocar a anatomia normal da glândula. 

Isso pode criar uma aparência conhecida como “bola na mão” em um sialograma, onde os ductos são curvados em torno da massa da lesão. Sialoquímica

A composição da saliva muda nos estados de doença e a análise da saliva para enzimas, eletrólitos, hormônios, drogas e estado de imunização pode ser realizada. Cintilografia com radioisótopos

Dá uma medida objetiva da absorção e excreção de isótopos usando uma câmera de cintilação gama.

Após cerca de 20 minutos, um estimulante salivar será administrado para promover o fluxo salivar através da glândula.

Eles são usados ​​para avaliar pacientes com sintomas persistentes de boca seca e também para avaliar o inchaço das glândulas salivares devido a infecção, inflamação ou obstrução.


=== Testes adicionais ===

-Técnicas de imaginação

-Ultrassom, tomografia computadorizada ou ressonância magnética podem ajudar na localização da doença

-Sialoendoscopia

-Uma câmera é inserida no ducto de uma glândula salivar para avaliar bloqueios

-Biópsia

-Isso pode ser feito por biópsia aspirativa por agulha fina, que oferece uma oportunidade de obter informações sobre a histologia de um tumor salivar antes do início do tratamento.
