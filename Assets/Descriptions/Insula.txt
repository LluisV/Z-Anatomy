INSULAR CORTEX


The insular cortex (also insula and insular lobe) is a portion of the cerebral cortex folded deep within the lateral sulcus (the fissure separating the temporal lobe from the parietal and frontal lobes) within each hemisphere of the mammalian brain.

The insulae are believed to be involved in consciousness and play a role in diverse functions usually linked to emotion or the regulation of the body's homeostasis. 

These functions include compassion, empathy, taste, perception, motor control, self-awareness, cognitive functioning, interpersonal experience, and awareness of homeostatic emotions such as hunger, pain and fatigue. 

In relation to these, it is involved in psychopathology.

The insular cortex is divided into two parts: the anterior insula and the posterior insula in which more than a dozen field areas have been identified. 

The cortical area overlying the insula toward the lateral surface of the brain is the operculum (meaning lid). 

The opercula are formed from parts of the enclosing frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.


== Structure ==


=== Connections ===

The anterior part of the insula is subdivided by shallow sulci into three or four short gyri.

The anterior insula receives a direct projection from the basal part of the ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus and a particularly large input from the central nucleus of the amygdala. 

In addition, the anterior insula itself projects to the amygdala.

One study on rhesus monkeys revealed widespread reciprocal connections between the insular cortex and almost all subnuclei of the amygdaloid complex. 

The posterior insula projects predominantly to the dorsal aspect of the lateral and to the central amygdaloid nuclei. 

In contrast, the anterior insula projects to the anterior amygdaloid area as well as the medial, the cortical, the accessory basal magnocellular, the medial basal, and the lateral amygdaloid nuclei.

The posterior part of the insula is formed by a long gyrus.

The posterior insula connects reciprocally with the secondary somatosensory cortex and receives input from spinothalamically activated ventral posterior inferior thalamic nuclei. 

It has also been shown that this region receives inputs from the ventromedial nucleus (posterior part) of the thalamus that are highly specialized to convey homeostatic information such as pain, temperature, itch, local oxygen status, and sensual touch.

A human neuroimaging study using diffusion tensor imaging revealed that the anterior insula is interconnected to regions in the temporal and occipital lobe, opercular and orbitofrontal cortex, triangular and opercular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus. 

The same study revealed differences in the anatomical connection patterns between the left and right hemisphere.

The 'circular sulcus of insula' (or sulcus of Reil) is a semi-circular sulcus or fissure that separates the insula from the neighboring gyri of the operculum in the front, above, and
behind.


=== Cytoarchitecture ===

The insular cortex has regions of variable cell structure or cytoarchitecture, changing from granular in the posterior portion to agranular in the anterior portion. 

The insula also receives differential cortical and thalamic input along its length. 

The anterior insular cortex contains a population of spindle neurons (also called von Economo neurons), identified as characterising a distinctive subregion as the agranular frontal insula.


=== Development ===

The insular cortex is considered a separate lobe of the telencephalon by some authorities. 

Other sources see the insula as a part of the temporal lobe. 

It is also sometimes grouped with limbic structures deep in the brain into a limbic lobe. 

As a paralimbic cortex, the insular cortex is considered to be a relatively old structure.


== Function ==


=== Multimodal sensory processing, sensory binding ===

Functional imaging studies show activation of the insula during audio-visual integration tasks.


=== Taste ===

The anterior insula is part of the primary gustatory cortex.


=== Interoceptive awareness ===

There is evidence that, in addition to its base functions, the insula may play a role in certain higher-level functions that operate only in humans and other great apes. 

The spindle neurons found at a higher density in the right frontal insular cortex are also found in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is another region that has reached a high level of specialization in great apes. 

It has been speculated that these neurons are involved in cognitive-emotional processes that are specific to primates including great apes, such as empathy and metacognitive emotional feelings. 

This is supported by functional imaging results showing that the structure and function of the right frontal insula is correlated with the ability to feel one's own heartbeat, or to empathize with the pain of others. 

It is thought that these functions are not distinct from the lower-level functions of the insula but rather arise as a consequence of the role of the insula in conveying homeostatic information to consciousness. 

The right anterior insula is engaged in interoceptive awareness of homeostatic emotions such as thirst, pain and fatigue, and the ability to time one's own heartbeat. 

Moreover, greater right anterior insular gray matter volume correlates with increased accuracy in this subjective sense of the inner body, and with negative emotional experience. 

It is also involved in the control of blood pressure, in particular during and after exercise, and its activity varies with the amount of effort a person believes he/she is exerting.

The insular cortex also is where the sensation of pain is judged as to its degree. 

Further, the insula is where a person imagines pain when looking at images of painful events while thinking about their happening to one's own body. 

Those with irritable bowel syndrome have abnormal processing of visceral pain in the insular cortex related to dysfunctional inhibition of pain within the brain.Another perception of the right anterior insula is the degree of nonpainful warmth or nonpainful coldness of a skin sensation. 

Other internal sensations processed by the insula include stomach or abdominal distension. 

A full bladder also activates the insular cortex.One brain imaging study suggests that the unpleasantness of subjectively perceived dyspnea is processed in the right human anterior insula and amygdala.

The cerebral cortex processing vestibular sensations extends into the insula, with small lesions in the anterior insular cortex being able to cause loss of balance and vertigo.

Other noninteroceptive perceptions include passive listening to music, laughter, and crying, empathy and compassion, and language.


=== Motor control ===

In motor control, it contributes to hand-and-eye motor movement, swallowing, gastric motility, and speech articulation. 

It has been identified as a "central command” centre that ensures that heart rate and blood pressure increase at the onset of exercise. 

Research upon conversation links it to the capacity for long and complex spoken sentences. 

It is also involved in motor learning and has been identified as playing a role in the motor recovery from stroke.


=== Homeostasis ===

It plays a role in a variety of homeostatic functions related to basic survival needs, such as taste, visceral sensation, and autonomic control. 

The insula controls autonomic functions through the regulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. 

It has a role in regulating the immune system.


=== Self ===

The insula has been identified as playing a role in the experience of bodily self-awareness, sense of agency, and sense of body ownership.


=== Social emotions ===

The anterior insula processes a person's sense of disgust both to smells and to the sight of contamination and mutilation — even when just imagining the experience. 

This associates with a mirror neuron-like link between external and internal experiences.

In social experience, it is involved in the processing of norm violations, emotional processing, empathy, and orgasms.The insula is active during social decision making. 

Tiziana Quarto et al. measured emotional intelligence (EI) (the ability to identify, regulate, and process emotions of themselves and of others) of sixty-three healthy subjects. 

Using fMRI EI was measured in correlation with left insular activity. 

The subjects were shown various pictures of facial expressions and tasked with deciding to approach or avoid the person in the picture. 

The results of the social decision task yielded that individuals with high EI scores had left insular activation when processing fearful faces. 

Individuals with low EI scores had left insular activation when processing angry faces.


=== Emotions ===

The insular cortex, in particular its most anterior portion, is considered a limbic-related cortex. 

The insula has increasingly become the focus of attention for its role in body representation and subjective emotional experience. 

In particular, Antonio Damasio has proposed that this region plays a role in mapping visceral states that are associated with emotional experience, giving rise to conscious feelings. 

This is in essence a neurobiological formulation of the ideas of William James, who first proposed that subjective emotional experience (i.e., feelings) arise from our brain's interpretation of bodily states that are elicited by emotional events. 

This is an example of embodied cognition.
In terms of function, the insula is believed to process convergent information to produce an emotionally relevant context for sensory experience. 

To be specific, the anterior insula is related more to olfactory, gustatory, viscero-autonomic, and limbic function, whereas the posterior insula is related more to auditory-somesthetic-skeletomotor function. 

Functional imaging experiments have revealed that the insula has an important role in pain experience and the experience of a number of basic emotions, including anger, fear, disgust, happiness, and sadness.The anterior insular cortex (AIC) is believed to be responsible for emotional feelings, including maternal and romantic love, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, sexual arousal, disgust, aversion, unfairness, inequity, indignation, uncertainty, disbelief, social exclusion, trust, empathy, sculptural beauty, a ‘state of union with God’, and hallucinogenic states.

Functional imaging studies have also implicated the insula in conscious desires, such as food craving and drug craving. 

What is common to all of these emotional states is that they each change the body in some way and are associated with highly salient subjective qualities. 

The insula is well-situated for the integration of information relating to bodily states into higher-order cognitive and emotional processes. 

The insula receives information from "homeostatic afferent" sensory pathways via the thalamus and sends output to a number of other limbic-related structures, such as the amygdala, the ventral striatum, and the orbitofrontal cortex, as well as to motor cortices.

A study using magnetic resonance imaging found that the right anterior insula is significantly thicker in people that meditate. 

Other research into brain activity and meditation has shown an increase in grey matter in areas of the brain including the insular cortex.

Another study using voxel-based morphometry and MRI on experienced Vipassana meditators was done to extend the findings of Lazar et al., which found increased grey matter concentrations in this and other areas of the brain in experienced meditators.

The strongest evidence against a causative role for the insula cortex in emotion comes from Damasio et al. (2012) which showed that a patient who suffered bilateral lesions of the insula cortex expressed the full complement of human emotions, and was fully capable of emotional learning.


=== Salience ===

Functional neuroimaging research suggests the insula is involved in two types of salience. 

Interoceptive information processing that links interoception with emotional salience to generate a subjective representation of the body. 

This involves, first, the anterior insular cortex with the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 33) and the anterior and posterior mid-cingulate cortices, and, second, a general salience network concerned with environmental monitoring, response selection, and skeletomotor body orientation that involves all of the insular cortex and the mid-cingulate cortex.

An alternative or perhaps complementary proposal is that the right anterior insular regulates the interaction between the salience of the selective attention created to achieve a task (the dorsal attention system) and the salience of arousal created to keep focused upon the relevant part of the environment (ventral attention system). 

This regulation of salience might be particularly important during challenging tasks where attention might fatigue and so cause careless mistakes but if there is too much arousal it risks creating poor performance by turning into anxiety.


=== Auditory perception ===

Recent research indicates that the insular cortex is involved in auditory perception. 

Responses to sound stimuli were obtained using intracranial EEG recordings acquired from patients with epilepsy. 

The posterior part of the insula showed auditory responses that resemble those observed in Heschl’s gyrus, whereas the anterior part responded to the emotional contents of the auditory stimuli.

Direct recordings from the posterior part of the insula showed responses to unexpected sounds within regular auditory streams, a process known as auditory deviance detection. 

Researchers observed a mismatch negativity (MMN) potential, a well known event related potential, as well as the high frequency activity signals originating from local neurons.

Simple auditory illusions and hallucinations were elicited by electrical functional mapping.


== Clinical significance ==


=== Progressive expressive aphasia ===

Progressive expressive aphasia is the deterioration of normal language function that causes individuals to lose the ability to communicate fluently while still being able to comprehend single words and intact other non-linguistic cognition. 

It is found in a variety of degenerative neurological conditions including Pick's disease, motor neuron disease, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. 

It is associated with hypometabolism and atrophy of the left anterior insular cortex.


=== Addiction ===

A number of functional brain imaging studies have shown that the insular cortex is activated when drug users are exposed to environmental cues that trigger cravings. 

This has been shown for a variety of drugs, including cocaine, alcohol, opiates, and nicotine. 

Despite these findings, the insula has been ignored within the drug addiction literature, perhaps because it is not known to be a direct target of the mesocortical dopamine system, which is central to current dopamine reward theories of addiction. 

Research published in 2007 has shown that cigarette smokers suffering damage to the insular cortex, from a stroke for instance, have their addiction to cigarettes practically eliminated. 

These individuals were found to be up to 136 times more likely to undergo a disruption of smoking addiction than smokers with damage in other areas. 

Disruption of addiction was evidenced by self-reported behavior changes such as quitting smoking less than one day after the brain injury, quitting smoking with great ease, not smoking again after quitting, and having no urge to resume smoking since quitting. 

The study was conducted on average eight years after the strokes, which opens up the possibility that recall bias could have affected the results. 

More recent prospective studies, which overcome this limitation, have corroborated these findings.

This suggests a significant role for the insular cortex in the neurological mechanisms underlying addiction to nicotine and other drugs, and would make this area of the brain a possible target for novel anti-addiction medication. 

In addition, this finding suggests that functions mediated by the insula, especially conscious feelings, may be particularly important for maintaining drug addiction, although this view is not represented in any modern research or reviews of the subject.

A recent study in rats by Contreras et al. corroborates these findings by showing that reversible inactivation of the insula disrupts amphetamine conditioned place preference, an animal model of cue-induced drug craving. 

In this study, insula inactivation also disrupted "malaise" responses to lithium chloride injection, suggesting that the representation of negative interoceptive states by the insula plays a role in addiction. 

However, in this same study, the conditioned place preference took place immediately after the injection of amphetamine, suggesting that it is the immediate, pleasurable interoceptive effects of amphetamine administration, rather than the delayed, aversive effects of amphetamine withdrawal that are represented within the insula.

A model proposed by Naqvi et al. (see above) is that the insula stores a representation of the pleasurable interoceptive effects of drug use (e.g., the airway sensory effects of nicotine, the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine), and that this representation is activated by exposure to cues that have previously been associated with drug use. 

A number of functional imaging studies have shown the insula to be activated during the administration of addictive psychoactive drugs. 

Several functional imaging studies have also shown that the insula is activated when drug users are exposed to drug cues, and that this activity is correlated with subjective urges. 

In the cue-exposure studies, insula activity is elicited when there is no actual change in the level of drug in the body. 

Therefore, rather than merely representing the interoceptive effects of drug use as it occurs, the insula may play a role in memory for the pleasurable interoceptive effects of past drug use, anticipation of these effects in the future, or both. 

Such a representation may give rise to conscious urges that feel as if they arise from within the body. 

This may make addicts feel as if their bodies need to use a drug, and may result in persons with lesions in the insula reporting that their bodies have forgotten the urge to use, according to this study.


=== Subjective certainty in ecstatic seizures ===

A common quality in mystical experiences is a strong feeling of certainty which cannot be expressed in words. 

Fabienne Picard proposes a neurological explanation for this subjective certainty, based on clinical research of epilepsy. 

According to Picard, this feeling of certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the anterior insula, a part of the brain which is involved in interoception, self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by "anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk". 

This avoidance of uncertainty functions through the comparison between predicted states and actual states, that is, "signaling that we do not understand, i.e., that there is ambiguity." 

Picard notes that "the concept of insight is very close to that of certainty," and refers to Archimedes' "Eureka!" Picard hypothesizes that during ecstatic seizures the comparison between predicted states and actual states no longer functions, and that mismatches between predicted state and actual state are no longer processed, blocking "negative emotions and negative arousal arising from predictive uncertainty," which will be experienced as emotional confidence. 

Picard concludes that "[t]his could lead to a spiritual interpretation in some individuals."


=== Other clinical conditions ===

The insular cortex has been suggested to have a role in anxiety disorders, emotion dysregulation, and anorexia nervosa.


== History ==

The insula was first described by Johann Christian Reil while describing cranial and spinal nerves and plexuses. 

Henry Gray in Gray's Anatomy is responsible for it being known as the Island of Reil. 

John Allman and colleagues showed that anterior insular cortex contains spindle neurons.

CORTEZA INSULAR


La corteza insular (también ínsula y lóbulo insular) es una porción de la corteza cerebral plegada profundamente dentro del surco lateral (la fisura que separa el lóbulo temporal de los lóbulos parietal y frontal) dentro de cada hemisferio del cerebro de los mamíferos.

Se cree que las ínsulas están involucradas en la conciencia y desempeñan un papel en diversas funciones generalmente relacionadas con la emoción o la regulación de la homeostasis del cuerpo.

Estas funciones incluyen la compasión, la empatía, el gusto, la percepción, el control motor, la autoconciencia, el funcionamiento cognitivo, la experiencia interpersonal y la conciencia de las emociones homeostáticas como el hambre, el dolor y la fatiga.

En relación con estos, se involucra en la psicopatología.

La corteza insular se divide en dos partes: la ínsula anterior y la ínsula posterior en las que se han identificado más de una docena de áreas de campo.

El área cortical que recubre la ínsula hacia la superficie lateral del cerebro es el opérculo (que significa tapa).

Los opérculos se forman a partir de partes de los lóbulos frontal, temporal y parietal que los encierran.


== Estructura ==


=== Conexiones ===

La parte anterior de la ínsula está subdividida por surcos poco profundos en tres o cuatro circunvoluciones cortas.

La ínsula anterior recibe una proyección directa de la parte basal del núcleo medial ventral del tálamo y una entrada particularmente grande del núcleo central de la amígdala.

Además, la propia ínsula anterior se proyecta hacia la amígdala.

Un estudio sobre monos rhesus reveló conexiones recíprocas generalizadas entre la corteza insular y casi todos los subnúcleos del complejo amigdaloide.

La ínsula posterior se proyecta predominantemente hacia la cara dorsal de los núcleos amigdalinos lateral y central.

Por el contrario, la ínsula anterior se proyecta al área amigdaloide anterior, así como a los núcleos medial, cortical, magnocelular basal accesorio, basal medial y amigdaloide lateral.

La parte posterior de la ínsula está formada por una circunvolución larga.

La ínsula posterior se conecta recíprocamente con la corteza somatosensorial secundaria y recibe información de los núcleos talámicos inferiores posteriores ventrales activados espinotalámicamente.

También se ha demostrado que esta región recibe información del núcleo ventromedial (parte posterior) del tálamo que está altamente especializada para transmitir información homeostática como dolor, temperatura, picazón, estado de oxígeno local y tacto sensual.

Un estudio de neuroimagen humana que utilizó imágenes de tensor de difusión reveló que la ínsula anterior está interconectada con regiones en el lóbulo temporal y occipital, la corteza opercular y orbitofrontal, las partes triangulares y operculares de la circunvolución frontal inferior. 

El mismo estudio reveló diferencias en los patrones de conexión anatómica entre el hemisferio izquierdo y derecho.

El 'surco circular de la ínsula' (o surco de Reil) es un surco semicircular o fisura que separa la ínsula de las circunvoluciones vecinas del opérculo en el frente, arriba y
detrás.


=== Citoarquitectura ===

La corteza insular tiene regiones de estructura celular variable o citoarquitectura, cambiando de granular en la porción posterior a agranular en la porción anterior. 

La ínsula también recibe información cortical y talámica diferencial a lo largo de su longitud. 

La corteza insular anterior contiene una población de neuronas fusiformes (también llamadas neuronas de von Economo), identificadas como características de una subregión distintiva como la ínsula frontal agranular.


=== Desarrollo ===

Algunas autoridades consideran que la corteza insular es un lóbulo separado del telencéfalo.

Otras fuentes ven la ínsula como parte del lóbulo temporal.

A veces también se agrupa con estructuras límbicas en lo profundo del cerebro en un lóbulo límbico.

Como corteza paralímbica, la corteza insular se considera una estructura relativamente antigua.


== Función ==


=== Procesamiento sensorial multimodal, unión sensorial ===

Los estudios de imagen funcional muestran la activación de la ínsula durante las tareas de integración audiovisual.


=== Sabor ===

La ínsula anterior es parte de la corteza gustativa primaria.


=== Conciencia interoceptiva ===

Existe evidencia de que, además de sus funciones básicas, la ínsula puede desempeñar un papel en ciertas funciones de nivel superior que operan solo en humanos y otros grandes simios. 

Las neuronas fusiformes que se encuentran con mayor densidad en la corteza insular frontal derecha también se encuentran en la corteza cingulada anterior, que es otra región que ha alcanzado un alto nivel de especialización en los grandes simios. 

Se ha especulado que estas neuronas están involucradas en procesos cognitivo-emocionales que son específicos de los primates, incluidos los grandes simios, como la empatía y los sentimientos emocionales metacognitivos. 

Esto está respaldado por resultados de imágenes funcionales que muestran que la estructura y la función de la ínsula frontal derecha se correlacionan con la capacidad de sentir el propio latido del corazón o de empatizar con el dolor de los demás. 

Se cree que estas funciones no son distintas de las funciones de nivel inferior de la ínsula, sino que surgen como consecuencia del papel de la ínsula en la transmisión de información homeostática a la conciencia.

La ínsula anterior derecha participa en la conciencia interoceptiva de las emociones homeostáticas como la sed, el dolor y la fatiga, y en la capacidad de cronometrar los latidos del propio corazón.

Además, un mayor volumen de materia gris insular anterior derecha se correlaciona con una mayor precisión en este sentido subjetivo del cuerpo interno y con una experiencia emocional negativa.

También interviene en el control de la presión arterial, en particular durante y después del ejercicio, y su actividad varía con la cantidad de esfuerzo que la persona cree que está realizando.

La corteza insular también es donde se juzga la sensación de dolor en cuanto a su grado.

Además, la ínsula es donde una persona imagina dolor cuando mira imágenes de eventos dolorosos mientras piensa en que le suceden a su propio cuerpo.

Las personas con síndrome del intestino irritable tienen un procesamiento anormal del dolor visceral en la corteza insular relacionado con la inhibición disfuncional del dolor dentro del cerebro. Otra percepción de la ínsula anterior derecha es el grado de calor no doloroso o frialdad no dolorosa de una sensación en la piel.

Otras sensaciones internas procesadas por la ínsula incluyen distensión estomacal o abdominal.

Una vejiga llena también activa la corteza insular. Un estudio de imágenes cerebrales sugiere que el malestar de la disnea percibida subjetivamente se procesa en la ínsula anterior y la amígdala humanas derechas.

La corteza cerebral que procesa las sensaciones vestibulares se extiende hacia la ínsula, con pequeñas lesiones en la corteza insular anterior que pueden causar pérdida del equilibrio y vértigo.

Otras percepciones no interoceptivas incluyen la escucha pasiva de música, la risa y el llanto, la empatía y la compasión y el lenguaje.


=== Control de motores ===

En el control motor, contribuye al movimiento motor de manos y ojos, la deglución, la motilidad gástrica y la articulación del habla.

Se ha identificado como un centro de "comando central" que asegura que la frecuencia cardíaca y la presión arterial aumenten al inicio del ejercicio.

La investigación sobre la conversación la relaciona con la capacidad de pronunciar oraciones largas y complejas.

También está involucrado en el aprendizaje motor y se ha identificado que desempeña un papel en la recuperación motora del accidente cerebrovascular.


=== Homeostasis ===

Desempeña un papel en una variedad de funciones homeostáticas relacionadas con las necesidades básicas de supervivencia, como el gusto, la sensación visceral y el control autónomo. 

La ínsula controla las funciones autonómicas a través de la regulación de los sistemas simpático y parasimpático. 

Tiene un papel en la regulación del sistema inmunológico.


=== Yo mismo ===

Se ha identificado que la ínsula desempeña un papel en la experiencia de la autoconciencia corporal, el sentido de agencia y el sentido de propiedad del cuerpo.


=== Emociones sociales ===

La ínsula anterior procesa la sensación de disgusto de una persona tanto por los olores como por la visión de la contaminación y la mutilación, incluso cuando solo imagina la experiencia. 

Esto se asocia con un vínculo similar a una neurona espejo entre las experiencias externas e internas.

En la experiencia social, está involucrada en el procesamiento de violaciones de normas, procesamiento emocional, empatía y orgasmos. La ínsula está activa durante la toma de decisiones sociales. 

Tiziana Cuarto et al. midieron la inteligencia emocional (IE) (la capacidad de identificar, regular y procesar las emociones de ellos mismos y de los demás) de sesenta y tres sujetos sanos.

Usando fMRI EI se midió en correlación con la actividad insular izquierda. 

A los sujetos se les mostraron varias imágenes de expresiones faciales y se les pidió que decidieran acercarse o evitar a la persona en la imagen. 

Los resultados de la tarea de decisión social arrojaron que las personas con puntajes altos de IE habían dejado la activación insular al procesar rostros temerosos. 

Los individuos con puntajes bajos de IE habían dejado la activación insular al procesar rostros enojados.


=== Emociones ===

La corteza insular, en particular su porción más anterior, se considera una corteza relacionada con el limbo. 

La ínsula se ha convertido cada vez más en el foco de atención por su papel en la representación del cuerpo y la experiencia emocional subjetiva. 

En particular, Antonio Damasio ha propuesto que esta región juega un papel en el mapeo de estados viscerales que están asociados con la experiencia emocional, dando lugar a sentimientos conscientes. 

Esta es, en esencia, una formulación neurobiológica de las ideas de William James, quien primero propuso que la experiencia emocional subjetiva (es decir, los sentimientos) surgen de la interpretación de nuestro cerebro de los estados corporales que son provocados por eventos emocionales. 

Este es un ejemplo de cognición incorporada.
En términos de función, se cree que la ínsula procesa información convergente para producir un contexto emocionalmente relevante para la experiencia sensorial. 

En concreto, la ínsula anterior se relaciona más con la función olfativa, gustativa, visceroautonómica y límbica, mientras que la ínsula posterior se relaciona más con la función auditivo-somestésico-esqueletomotora. 

Los experimentos con imágenes funcionales han revelado que la ínsula tiene un papel importante en la experiencia del dolor y en la experiencia de una serie de emociones básicas, como la ira, el miedo, el disgusto, la felicidad y la tristeza. Se cree que la corteza insular anterior (AIC) es responsable de sentimientos emocionales, incluidos el amor materno y romántico, la ira, el miedo, la tristeza, la felicidad, la excitación sexual, el disgusto, la aversión, la injusticia, la inequidad, la indignación, la incertidumbre, la incredulidad, la exclusión social, la confianza, la empatía, la belleza escultórica, un 'estado de unión con Dios', y estados alucinógenos.

Los estudios de imágenes funcionales también han implicado a la ínsula en los deseos conscientes, como el ansia de comer y de drogas. 

Lo que es común a todos estos estados emocionales es que cada uno cambia el cuerpo de alguna manera y están asociados con cualidades subjetivas muy destacadas. 

La ínsula está bien situada para la integración de información relacionada con estados corporales en procesos cognitivos y emocionales de orden superior. 

La ínsula recibe información de las vías sensoriales "aferentes homeostáticas" a través del tálamo y envía información a otras estructuras relacionadas con el sistema límbico, como la amígdala, el estriado ventral y la corteza orbitofrontal, así como a las cortezas motoras.

Un estudio que utilizó imágenes de resonancia magnética encontró que la ínsula anterior derecha es significativamente más gruesa en las personas que meditan. 

Otra investigación sobre la actividad cerebral y la meditación ha mostrado un aumento de la materia gris en áreas del cerebro, incluida la corteza insular.

Se realizó otro estudio que utilizó morfometría basada en vóxeles y MRI en meditadores experimentados de Vipassana para ampliar los hallazgos de Lazar et al., que encontraron concentraciones aumentadas de materia gris en esta y otras áreas del cerebro en meditadores experimentados.

La evidencia más sólida contra un papel causal de la corteza de la ínsula en la emoción proviene de Damasio et al. (2012) que mostró que un paciente que sufría lesiones bilaterales de la corteza de la ínsula expresaba el complemento completo de las emociones humanas y era completamente capaz de aprender emocionalmente.


=== Prominencia ===

La investigación de neuroimagen funcional sugiere que la ínsula está involucrada en dos tipos de prominencia.

Procesamiento de la información interoceptiva que vincula la interocepción con la prominencia emocional para generar una representación subjetiva del cuerpo.

Esto involucra, primero, la corteza insular anterior con la corteza cingulada anterior pregenual (área 33 de Brodmann) y las cortezas cinguladas medias anterior y posterior, y, segundo, una red de prominencia general relacionada con el monitoreo ambiental, la selección de respuestas y la orientación del cuerpo esqueletomotor. que involucra toda la corteza insular y la corteza cingulada media.

Una propuesta alternativa o quizás complementaria es que la ínsula anterior derecha regula la interacción entre la prominencia de la atención selectiva creada para lograr una tarea (el sistema de atención dorsal) y la prominencia de la activación creada para mantenerse enfocado en la parte relevante del entorno ( sistema de atención ventral).

Esta regulación de la prominencia puede ser particularmente importante durante las tareas desafiantes en las que la atención puede fatigarse y causar errores por descuido, pero si hay demasiada excitación, se corre el riesgo de generar un rendimiento deficiente al convertirse en ansiedad.


=== Percepción auditiva ===

Investigaciones recientes indican que la corteza insular está involucrada en la percepción auditiva. 

Las respuestas a los estímulos sonoros se obtuvieron mediante registros EEG intracraneales obtenidos de pacientes con epilepsia. 

La parte posterior de la ínsula mostró respuestas auditivas que se asemejan a las observadas en la circunvolución de Heschl, mientras que la parte anterior respondió a los contenidos emocionales de los estímulos auditivos.

Las grabaciones directas de la parte posterior de la ínsula mostraron respuestas a sonidos inesperados dentro de flujos auditivos regulares, un proceso conocido como detección de desviación auditiva. 

Los investigadores observaron un potencial de negatividad de desajuste (MMN), un potencial relacionado con eventos bien conocido, así como señales de actividad de alta frecuencia que se originan en las neuronas locales.

Las ilusiones auditivas simples y las alucinaciones fueron provocadas por el mapeo funcional eléctrico.


== Importancia clínica ==


=== Afasia expresiva progresiva ===

La afasia expresiva progresiva es el deterioro de la función normal del lenguaje que hace que las personas pierdan la capacidad de comunicarse con fluidez sin dejar de comprender palabras sueltas y mantener intacta otra cognición no lingüística. 

Se encuentra en una variedad de condiciones neurológicas degenerativas que incluyen la enfermedad de Pick, la enfermedad de la neurona motora, la degeneración corticobasal, la demencia frontotemporal y la enfermedad de Alzheimer. 

Se asocia con hipometabolismo y atrofia de la corteza insular anterior izquierda.


=== Adicción ===

Varios estudios de imágenes cerebrales funcionales han demostrado que la corteza insular se activa cuando los usuarios de drogas están expuestos a señales ambientales que desencadenan los antojos. 

Esto se ha demostrado para una variedad de drogas, como la cocaína, el alcohol, los opiáceos y la nicotina. 

A pesar de estos hallazgos, la ínsula ha sido ignorada dentro de la literatura sobre adicción a las drogas, tal vez porque no se sabe que sea un objetivo directo del sistema de dopamina mesocortical, que es fundamental para las teorías actuales de la adicción a la recompensa de la dopamina. 

Una investigación publicada en 2007 ha demostrado que los fumadores de cigarrillos que sufren daños en la corteza insular, por ejemplo, debido a un derrame cerebral, tienen prácticamente eliminada su adicción a los cigarrillos. 

Se descubrió que estas personas tenían hasta 136 veces más probabilidades de sufrir una interrupción de la adicción al tabaco que los fumadores con daños en otras áreas.

La interrupción de la adicción se evidenció mediante cambios de comportamiento autoinformados, como dejar de fumar menos de un día después de la lesión cerebral, dejar de fumar con gran facilidad, no volver a fumar después de dejar de fumar y no tener ganas de volver a fumar desde que dejó de fumar.

El estudio se realizó en promedio ocho años después de los accidentes cerebrovasculares, lo que abre la posibilidad de que el sesgo de recuerdo podría haber afectado los resultados.

Estudios prospectivos más recientes, que superan esta limitación, han corroborado estos hallazgos.

Esto sugiere un papel importante para la corteza insular en los mecanismos neurológicos que subyacen a la adicción a la nicotina y otras drogas, y haría de esta área del cerebro un posible objetivo para la nueva medicación contra la adicción.

Además, este hallazgo sugiere que las funciones mediadas por la ínsula, especialmente los sentimientos conscientes, pueden ser particularmente importantes para mantener la adicción a las drogas, aunque este punto de vista no está representado en ninguna investigación o revisión moderna sobre el tema.

Un estudio reciente en ratas de Contreras et al. corrobora estos hallazgos al mostrar que la inactivación reversible de la ínsula interrumpe la preferencia de lugar condicionada por anfetaminas, un modelo animal de ansia de drogas inducida por señales.

En este estudio, la inactivación de la ínsula también interrumpió las respuestas de "malestar" a la inyección de cloruro de litio, lo que sugiere que la representación de estados interoceptivos negativos por parte de la ínsula juega un papel en la adicción.

Sin embargo, en este mismo estudio, la preferencia de lugar condicionada tuvo lugar inmediatamente después de la inyección de anfetamina, lo que sugiere que son los efectos interoceptivos placenteros inmediatos de la administración de anfetamina, en lugar de los efectos aversivos tardíos de la abstinencia de anfetamina, los que están representados dentro de la ínsula. .

Un modelo propuesto por Naqvi et al. (ver arriba) es que la ínsula almacena una representación de los efectos interoceptivos placenteros del consumo de drogas (p. ej., los efectos sensoriales de la nicotina en las vías respiratorias, los efectos cardiovasculares de la anfetamina), y que esta representación se activa mediante la exposición a señales que han sido previamente detectadas. asociado al consumo de drogas.

Varios estudios de imágenes funcionales han demostrado que la ínsula se activa durante la administración de drogas psicoactivas adictivas.

Varios estudios de imágenes funcionales también han demostrado que la ínsula se activa cuando los usuarios de drogas están expuestos a señales de drogas, y que esta actividad se correlaciona con impulsos subjetivos.

En los estudios de exposición a señales, la actividad de la ínsula se provoca cuando no hay un cambio real en el nivel de fármaco en el cuerpo.

Por lo tanto, en lugar de simplemente representar los efectos interoceptivos del consumo de drogas tal como ocurre, la ínsula puede desempeñar un papel en la memoria de los efectos interoceptivos placenteros del consumo de drogas en el pasado, la anticipación de estos efectos en el futuro, o ambos. 

Tal representación puede dar lugar a impulsos conscientes que se sienten como si surgieran del interior del cuerpo. 

Esto puede hacer que los adictos sientan que sus cuerpos necesitan usar una droga, y puede resultar en que las personas con lesiones en la ínsula informen que sus cuerpos han olvidado la necesidad de usarla, según este estudio.


=== Certeza subjetiva en ataques de éxtasis ===

Una cualidad común en las experiencias místicas es un fuerte sentimiento de certeza que no puede expresarse con palabras. 

Fabienne Picard propone una explicación neurológica para esta certeza subjetiva, basada en la investigación clínica de la epilepsia. 

Según Picard, este sentimiento de certeza puede ser causado por una disfunción de la ínsula anterior, una parte del cerebro que está involucrada en la interocepción, la autorreflexión y en evitar la incertidumbre sobre las representaciones internas del mundo por "anticipación de resolución". de incertidumbre o riesgo". 

Esta evitación de la incertidumbre funciona a través de la comparación entre los estados predichos y los estados reales, es decir, "señalando que no entendemos, es decir, que hay ambigüedad". 

Picard señala que "el concepto de intuición es muy cercano al de certeza" y se refiere al "¡Eureka!" de Arquímedes. Picard plantea la hipótesis de que durante las convulsiones extáticas, la comparación entre los estados predichos y los estados reales ya no funciona, y que los desajustes entre el estado predicho y el estado real ya no se procesan, bloqueando "las emociones negativas y la excitación negativa que surge de la incertidumbre predictiva", que se experimentará como confianza emocional.

Picard concluye que "[t] esto podría conducir a una interpretación espiritual en algunos individuos".


=== Otras condiciones clínicas ===

Se ha sugerido que la corteza insular tiene un papel en los trastornos de ansiedad, la desregulación de las emociones y la anorexia nerviosa.


== Historia ==

La ínsula fue descrita por primera vez por Johann Christian Reil al describir los nervios y plexos craneales y espinales. 

Henry Gray en Grey's Anatomy es el responsable de que se la conozca como la Isla de Reil. 

John Allman y sus colegas demostraron que la corteza insular anterior contiene neuronas fusiformes.

CORTEX INSULAIRE


Le cortex insulaire (également insula et lobe insulaire) est une partie du cortex cérébral repliée profondément dans le sillon latéral (la fissure séparant le lobe temporal des lobes pariétaux et frontaux) dans chaque hémisphère du cerveau des mammifères.

Les insulae seraient impliquées dans la conscience et joueraient un rôle dans diverses fonctions généralement liées à l'émotion ou à la régulation de l'homéostasie du corps. 

Ces fonctions comprennent la compassion, l'empathie, le goût, la perception, le contrôle moteur, la conscience de soi, le fonctionnement cognitif, l'expérience interpersonnelle et la conscience des émotions homéostatiques telles que la faim, la douleur et la fatigue. 

Par rapport à ceux-ci, il est impliqué dans la psychopathologie.

Le cortex insulaire est divisé en deux parties : l'insula antérieure et l'insula postérieure dans lesquelles plus d'une douzaine de zones de champ ont été identifiées. 

La zone corticale recouvrant l'insula vers la surface latérale du cerveau est l'opercule (c'est-à-dire le couvercle). 

Les opercules sont formés à partir de parties des lobes frontaux, temporaux et pariétaux.


== Structure ==


=== Connexions ===

La partie antérieure de l'insula est subdivisée par des sillons peu profonds en trois ou quatre gyri courts.

L'insula antérieure reçoit une projection directe de la partie basale du noyau médian ventral du thalamus et un apport particulièrement important du noyau central de l'amygdale. 

De plus, l'insula antérieure elle-même se projette sur l'amygdale.

Une étude sur des singes rhésus a révélé des connexions réciproques généralisées entre le cortex insulaire et presque tous les sous-noyaux du complexe amygdaloïde. 

L'insula postérieure se projette principalement sur la face dorsale des noyaux latéral et central de l'amygdaloïde. 

En revanche, l'insula antérieure se projette sur la zone amygdaloïde antérieure ainsi que sur les noyaux médial, cortical, magnocellulaire basal accessoire, basal médial et amygdaloïde latéral.

La partie postérieure de l'insula est formée par un long gyrus.

L'insula postérieure se connecte réciproquement avec le cortex somatosensoriel secondaire et reçoit l'entrée des noyaux thalamiques inférieurs postérieurs ventraux activés par la spinothalamie.

Il a également été démontré que cette région reçoit des entrées du noyau ventromédian (partie postérieure) du thalamus qui sont hautement spécialisées pour transmettre des informations homéostatiques telles que la douleur, la température, les démangeaisons, le statut local en oxygène et le toucher sensuel.

Une étude de neuroimagerie humaine utilisant l'imagerie du tenseur de diffusion a révélé que l'insula antérieure est interconnectée aux régions du lobe temporal et occipital, du cortex operculaire et orbitofrontal, des parties triangulaires et operculaires du gyrus frontal inférieur. 

La même étude a révélé des différences dans les modèles de connexion anatomique entre l'hémisphère gauche et droit.

Le 'sillon circulaire de l'insula' (ou sillon de Reil) est un sillon semi-circulaire ou une fissure qui sépare l'insula du gyri voisin de l'opercule à l'avant, au-dessus et
derrière.


=== Cytoarchitecture ===

Le cortex insulaire a des régions de structure cellulaire variable ou cytoarchitecture, passant de granulaire dans la partie postérieure à agranulaire dans la partie antérieure. 

L'insula reçoit également des entrées corticales et thalamiques différentielles sur sa longueur. 

Le cortex insulaire antérieur contient une population de neurones fusiformes (également appelés neurones de von Economo), identifiés comme caractérisant une sous-région distincte comme l'insula frontale agranulaire.


=== Développement ===

Le cortex insulaire est considéré comme un lobe séparé du télencéphale par certaines autorités. 

D'autres sources voient l'insula comme une partie du lobe temporal. 

Il est également parfois regroupé avec des structures limbiques profondément dans le cerveau dans un lobe limbique. 

En tant que cortex paralimbique, le cortex insulaire est considéré comme une structure relativement ancienne.


== Fonction ==


=== Traitement sensoriel multimodal, liaison sensorielle ===

Les études d'imagerie fonctionnelle montrent l'activation de l'insula lors de tâches d'intégration audiovisuelle.


=== Goût ===

L'insula antérieure fait partie du cortex gustatif primaire.


=== Conscience intéroceptive ===

Il est prouvé qu'en plus de ses fonctions de base, l'insula peut jouer un rôle dans certaines fonctions de niveau supérieur qui n'opèrent que chez l'homme et d'autres grands singes. 

Les neurones du fuseau trouvés à une densité plus élevée dans le cortex insulaire frontal droit se trouvent également dans le cortex cingulaire antérieur, qui est une autre région qui a atteint un haut niveau de spécialisation chez les grands singes. 

Il a été supposé que ces neurones sont impliqués dans des processus cognitivo-émotionnels spécifiques aux primates, y compris les grands singes, tels que l'empathie et les sentiments émotionnels métacognitifs. 

Ceci est étayé par des résultats d'imagerie fonctionnelle montrant que la structure et la fonction de l'insula frontale droite sont corrélées avec la capacité à ressentir son propre rythme cardiaque ou à sympathiser avec la douleur des autres. 

On pense que ces fonctions ne sont pas distinctes des fonctions de niveau inférieur de l'insula, mais résultent plutôt du rôle de l'insula dans la transmission d'informations homéostatiques à la conscience. 

L'insula antérieure droite est engagée dans la conscience intéroceptive des émotions homéostatiques telles que la soif, la douleur et la fatigue, et la capacité de chronométrer son propre rythme cardiaque. 

De plus, un plus grand volume de matière grise insulaire antérieure droite est corrélé à une précision accrue dans ce sens subjectif du corps interne et à une expérience émotionnelle négative. 

Il est également impliqué dans le contrôle de la tension artérielle, en particulier pendant et après l'exercice, et son activité varie en fonction de la quantité d'effort qu'une personne croit fournir.

Le cortex insulaire est également l'endroit où la sensation de douleur est jugée quant à son degré. 

De plus, l'insula est l'endroit où une personne imagine de la douleur lorsqu'elle regarde des images d'événements douloureux tout en pensant à leur propre corps.

Les personnes atteintes du syndrome du côlon irritable présentent un traitement anormal de la douleur viscérale dans le cortex insulaire lié à une inhibition dysfonctionnelle de la douleur dans le cerveau. Une autre perception de l'insula antérieure droite est le degré de chaleur non douloureuse ou de froideur non douloureuse d'une sensation cutanée.

D'autres sensations internes traitées par l'insula comprennent la distension de l'estomac ou de l'abdomen.

Une vessie pleine active également le cortex insulaire. Une étude d'imagerie cérébrale suggère que le désagrément de la dyspnée subjectivement perçue est traité dans l'insula antérieure et l'amygdale humaines droites.

Le cortex cérébral traitant les sensations vestibulaires s'étend dans l'insula, de petites lésions dans le cortex insulaire antérieur pouvant provoquer des pertes d'équilibre et des vertiges.

D'autres perceptions non intéroceptives incluent l'écoute passive de la musique, le rire et les pleurs, l'empathie et la compassion, et le langage.


=== Commande moteur ===

Dans le contrôle moteur, il contribue au mouvement moteur main-œil, à la déglutition, à la motilité gastrique et à l'articulation de la parole. 

Il a été identifié comme un centre de "commande centrale" qui veille à ce que la fréquence cardiaque et la pression artérielle augmentent au début de l'exercice. 

Les recherches sur la conversation l'associent à la capacité de prononcer des phrases longues et complexes à l'oral. 

Il est également impliqué dans l'apprentissage moteur et a été identifié comme jouant un rôle dans la récupération motrice après un AVC.


=== Homéostasie ===

Il joue un rôle dans une variété de fonctions homéostatiques liées aux besoins de survie de base, tels que le goût, la sensation viscérale et le contrôle autonome. 

L'insula contrôle les fonctions autonomes par la régulation des systèmes sympathique et parasympathique. 

Il a un rôle dans la régulation du système immunitaire.


=== Soi ===

L'insula a été identifiée comme jouant un rôle dans l'expérience de la conscience de soi corporelle, le sens de l'agence et le sens de la propriété du corps.


=== Émotions sociales ===

L'insula antérieure traite le sentiment de dégoût d'une personne à la fois aux odeurs et à la vue de la contamination et de la mutilation - même en imaginant simplement l'expérience. 

Cela s'associe à un lien de type neurone miroir entre les expériences externes et internes.

Dans l'expérience sociale, il est impliqué dans le traitement des violations des normes, du traitement émotionnel, de l'empathie et des orgasmes. L'insula est active lors de la prise de décision sociale.

Tiziana Quarto et al. mesuré l'intelligence émotionnelle (IE) (la capacité d'identifier, de réguler et de traiter les émotions d'eux-mêmes et des autres) de soixante-trois sujets sains.

En utilisant l'IRMf, l'IE a été mesurée en corrélation avec l'activité insulaire gauche.

Les sujets ont vu diverses images d'expressions faciales et ont été chargés de décider d'approcher ou d'éviter la personne sur la photo.

Les résultats de la tâche de décision sociale ont montré que les individus ayant des scores élevés d'IE avaient laissé une activation insulaire lors du traitement des visages craintifs.

Les personnes ayant de faibles scores d'IE avaient laissé une activation insulaire lors du traitement des visages en colère.


=== Émotions ===

Le cortex insulaire, en particulier sa partie la plus antérieure, est considéré comme un cortex limbique. 

L'insula est de plus en plus au centre de l'attention pour son rôle dans la représentation du corps et l'expérience émotionnelle subjective. 

En particulier, Antonio Damasio a proposé que cette région joue un rôle dans la cartographie des états viscéraux associés à l'expérience émotionnelle, donnant lieu à des sentiments conscients. 

Il s'agit essentiellement d'une formulation neurobiologique des idées de William James, qui a d'abord proposé que l'expérience émotionnelle subjective (c'est-à-dire les sentiments) découle de l'interprétation par notre cerveau des états corporels provoqués par des événements émotionnels. 

Ceci est un exemple de cognition incarnée.
En termes de fonction, on pense que l'insula traite des informations convergentes pour produire un contexte émotionnellement pertinent pour l'expérience sensorielle. 

Pour être précis, l'insula antérieure est davantage liée à la fonction olfactive, gustative, viscéro-autonomique et limbique, tandis que l'insula postérieure est davantage liée à la fonction auditive-somesthésique-squelettique. 

Des expériences d'imagerie fonctionnelle ont révélé que l'insula joue un rôle important dans l'expérience de la douleur et l'expérience d'un certain nombre d'émotions de base, notamment la colère, la peur, le dégoût, le bonheur et la tristesse. On pense que le cortex insulaire antérieur (AIC) est responsable de sentiments émotionnels, y compris l'amour maternel et romantique, la colère, la peur, la tristesse, le bonheur, l'excitation sexuelle, le dégoût, l'aversion, l'injustice, l'iniquité, l'indignation, l'incertitude, l'incrédulité, l'exclusion sociale, la confiance, l'empathie, la beauté sculpturale, un "état d'union avec Dieu', et les états hallucinogènes.

Des études d'imagerie fonctionnelle ont également impliqué l'insula dans des désirs conscients, tels que le besoin de nourriture et le besoin de drogue. 

Ce qui est commun à tous ces états émotionnels, c'est qu'ils modifient chacun le corps d'une manière ou d'une autre et sont associés à des qualités subjectives très saillantes. 

L'insula est bien située pour l'intégration des informations relatives aux états corporels dans les processus cognitifs et émotionnels d'ordre supérieur. 

L'insula reçoit des informations des voies sensorielles «afférentes homéostatiques» via le thalamus et envoie une sortie à un certain nombre d'autres structures liées au limbe, telles que l'amygdale, le striatum ventral et le cortex orbitofrontal, ainsi qu'aux cortex moteurs.

Une étude utilisant l'imagerie par résonance magnétique a révélé que l'insula antérieure droite est significativement plus épaisse chez les personnes qui méditent. 

D'autres recherches sur l'activité cérébrale et la méditation ont montré une augmentation de la matière grise dans des zones du cerveau, y compris le cortex insulaire.

Une autre étude utilisant la morphométrie basée sur le voxel et l'IRM sur des méditants Vipassana expérimentés a été réalisée pour étendre les découvertes de Lazar et al., qui ont trouvé une augmentation des concentrations de matière grise dans cette zone et d'autres régions du cerveau chez les méditants expérimentés.

La preuve la plus solide contre un rôle causal du cortex de l'insula dans l'émotion provient de Damasio et al. (2012) qui ont montré qu'un patient qui souffrait de lésions bilatérales du cortex de l'insula exprimait la totalité des émotions humaines et était parfaitement capable d'apprendre les émotions.


=== Pertinence ===

La recherche en neuroimagerie fonctionnelle suggère que l'insula est impliquée dans deux types de saillance. 

Traitement de l'information intéroceptive qui relie l'intéroception à la saillance émotionnelle pour générer une représentation subjective du corps. 

Cela implique, premièrement, le cortex insulaire antérieur avec le cortex cingulaire antérieur prégénuel (zone de Brodmann 33) et les cortex médio-cingulaires antérieur et postérieur, et, deuxièmement, un réseau de saillance général concerné par la surveillance de l'environnement, la sélection des réponses et l'orientation du corps squelettique. qui implique tout le cortex insulaire et le cortex médio-cingulaire.

Une proposition alternative ou peut-être complémentaire est que l'insulaire antérieur droit régule l'interaction entre la saillance de l'attention sélective créée pour accomplir une tâche (le système d'attention dorsale) et la saillance de l'excitation créée pour rester concentré sur la partie pertinente de l'environnement ( système attentionnel ventral). 

Cette régulation de la saillance peut être particulièrement importante lors de tâches difficiles où l'attention peut fatiguer et ainsi provoquer des erreurs d'inattention, mais s'il y a trop d'excitation, cela risque de créer de mauvaises performances en se transformant en anxiété.


=== Perception auditive ===

Des recherches récentes indiquent que le cortex insulaire est impliqué dans la perception auditive.

Les réponses aux stimuli sonores ont été obtenues à l'aide d'enregistrements EEG intracrâniens acquis auprès de patients épileptiques.

La partie postérieure de l'insula a montré des réponses auditives qui ressemblent à celles observées dans le gyrus de Heschl, tandis que la partie antérieure a répondu au contenu émotionnel des stimuli auditifs.

Des enregistrements directs de la partie postérieure de l'insula ont montré des réponses à des sons inattendus dans des flux auditifs réguliers, un processus connu sous le nom de détection de déviance auditive.

Les chercheurs ont observé un potentiel de négativité de mésappariement (MMN), un potentiel lié à un événement bien connu, ainsi que des signaux d'activité à haute fréquence provenant de neurones locaux.

De simples illusions auditives et hallucinations ont été provoquées par une cartographie fonctionnelle électrique.


== Signification clinique ==


=== Aphasie expressive progressive ===

L'aphasie expressive progressive est la détérioration de la fonction normale du langage qui fait que les individus perdent la capacité de communiquer couramment tout en étant capables de comprendre des mots simples et d'autres cognitions non linguistiques intactes.

On le trouve dans une variété d'affections neurologiques dégénératives, notamment la maladie de Pick, la maladie du motoneurone, la dégénérescence corticobasale, la démence frontotemporale et la maladie d'Alzheimer.

Elle est associée à un hypométabolisme et à une atrophie du cortex insulaire antérieur gauche.


=== Dépendance ===

Un certain nombre d'études d'imagerie cérébrale fonctionnelle ont montré que le cortex insulaire est activé lorsque les consommateurs de drogues sont exposés à des signaux environnementaux qui déclenchent des envies. 

Cela a été démontré pour une variété de drogues, y compris la cocaïne, l'alcool, les opiacés et la nicotine. 

Malgré ces découvertes, l'insula a été ignorée dans la littérature sur la toxicomanie, peut-être parce qu'elle n'est pas connue pour être une cible directe du système dopaminergique mésocortical, qui est au cœur des théories actuelles de la récompense dopaminergique de la dépendance. 

Des recherches publiées en 2007 ont montré que les fumeurs de cigarettes souffrant de lésions du cortex insulaire, suite à un accident vasculaire cérébral par exemple, voient leur dépendance à la cigarette pratiquement éliminée. 

Ces personnes se sont avérées jusqu'à 136 fois plus susceptibles de subir une perturbation de la dépendance au tabac que les fumeurs présentant des dommages dans d'autres domaines. 

La perturbation de la dépendance a été mise en évidence par des changements de comportement autodéclarés, tels que l'arrêt du tabac moins d'un jour après la lésion cérébrale, l'arrêt du tabac avec une grande facilité, le fait de ne plus fumer après l'arrêt et le fait de ne pas avoir envie de recommencer à fumer depuis l'arrêt. 

L'étude a été menée en moyenne huit ans après les accidents vasculaires cérébraux, ce qui ouvre la possibilité qu'un biais de rappel ait pu affecter les résultats. 

Des études prospectives plus récentes, qui surmontent cette limite, ont corroboré ces résultats.

Cela suggère un rôle important pour le cortex insulaire dans les mécanismes neurologiques sous-jacents à la dépendance à la nicotine et à d'autres drogues, et ferait de cette zone du cerveau une cible possible pour de nouveaux médicaments anti-addiction.

De plus, cette découverte suggère que les fonctions médiées par l'insula, en particulier les sentiments conscients, peuvent être particulièrement importantes pour le maintien de la toxicomanie, bien que ce point de vue ne soit représenté dans aucune recherche ou revue moderne sur le sujet.

Une étude récente chez le rat par Contreras et al. corrobore ces résultats en montrant que l'inactivation réversible de l'insula perturbe la préférence de lieu conditionnée par l'amphétamine, un modèle animal de soif de drogue induite par un signal.

Dans cette étude, l'inactivation de l'insula a également perturbé les réponses de "malaise" à l'injection de chlorure de lithium, suggérant que la représentation des états intéroceptifs négatifs par l'insula joue un rôle dans la dépendance. 

Cependant, dans cette même étude, la préférence de place conditionnée a eu lieu immédiatement après l'injection d'amphétamine, suggérant que ce sont les effets intéroceptifs immédiats et agréables de l'administration d'amphétamine, plutôt que les effets retardés et aversifs du sevrage d'amphétamine qui sont représentés dans l'insula. .

Un modèle proposé par Naqvi et al. (voir ci-dessus) est que l'insula stocke une représentation des effets intéroceptifs agréables de la consommation de drogue (par exemple, les effets sensoriels de la nicotine sur les voies respiratoires, les effets cardiovasculaires de l'amphétamine), et que cette représentation est activée par l'exposition à des signaux qui ont été précédemment associés à la consommation de drogue.

Un certain nombre d'études d'imagerie fonctionnelle ont montré que l'insula était activée lors de l'administration de drogues psychoactives addictives. 

Plusieurs études d'imagerie fonctionnelle ont également montré que l'insula est activée lorsque les usagers de drogues sont exposés à des signaux de drogue, et que cette activité est corrélée à des pulsions subjectives. 

Dans les études d'exposition aux signaux, l'activité de l'insula est déclenchée lorsqu'il n'y a pas de changement réel du niveau de médicament dans le corps. 

Par conséquent, plutôt que de simplement représenter les effets intéroceptifs de la consommation de drogue telle qu'elle se produit, l'insula peut jouer un rôle dans la mémoire pour les effets intéroceptifs agréables de la consommation passée de drogue, l'anticipation de ces effets dans le futur, ou les deux.

Une telle représentation peut donner lieu à des pulsions conscientes qui semblent provenir de l'intérieur du corps.

Selon cette étude, cela peut donner aux toxicomanes l'impression que leur corps a besoin d'utiliser une drogue et peut amener des personnes présentant des lésions dans l'insula à signaler que leur corps a oublié l'envie d'en consommer.


=== Certitude subjective dans les crises d'extase ===

Une qualité commune aux expériences mystiques est un fort sentiment de certitude qui ne peut être exprimé par des mots.

Fabienne Picard propose une explication neurologique de cette certitude subjective, basée sur la recherche clinique de l'épilepsie.

Selon Picard, ce sentiment de certitude pourrait être causé par un dysfonctionnement de l'insula antérieure, une partie du cerveau qui est impliquée dans l'intéroception, l'autoréflexion, et dans l'évitement de l'incertitude sur les représentations internes du monde par « anticipation de la résolution ». d'incertitude ou de risque ». 

Cet évitement de l'incertitude fonctionne grâce à la comparaison entre les états prédits et les états réels, c'est-à-dire "signalant que nous ne comprenons pas, c'est-à-dire qu'il y a une ambiguïté". 

Picard note que "le concept d'insight est très proche de celui de certitude" et fait référence à "Eureka!" d'Archimède. Picard émet l'hypothèse que pendant les crises d'extase, la comparaison entre les états prédits et les états réels ne fonctionne plus, et que les décalages entre l'état prédit et l'état réel ne sont plus traités, bloquant "les émotions négatives et l'excitation négative résultant de l'incertitude prédictive", qui seront vécues comme confiance émotionnelle.

Picard conclut que "[c] cela pourrait conduire à une interprétation spirituelle chez certains individus".


=== Autres conditions cliniques ===

Il a été suggéré que le cortex insulaire joue un rôle dans les troubles anxieux, la dérégulation des émotions et l'anorexie mentale.


== Historique ==

L'insula a été décrite pour la première fois par Johann Christian Reil lors de la description des nerfs et des plexus crâniens et rachidiens. 

Henry Gray dans Grey's Anatomy est responsable de son appellation d'île de Reil. 

John Allman et ses collègues ont montré que le cortex insulaire antérieur contient des neurones du fuseau.

CÓRTEX INSULAR


O córtex insular (também ínsula e lobo insular) é uma porção do córtex cerebral dobrada profundamente dentro do sulco lateral (a fissura que separa o lobo temporal dos lobos parietal e frontal) dentro de cada hemisfério do cérebro dos mamíferos.

Acredita-se que as ínsulas estão envolvidas na consciência e desempenham um papel em diversas funções geralmente ligadas à emoção ou à regulação da homeostase do corpo.

Essas funções incluem compaixão, empatia, paladar, percepção, controle motor, autoconsciência, funcionamento cognitivo, experiência interpessoal e consciência de emoções homeostáticas, como fome, dor e fadiga.

Em relação a estes, está envolvido na psicopatologia.

O córtex insular é dividido em duas partes: a ínsula anterior e a ínsula posterior na qual foram identificadas mais de uma dúzia de áreas de campo.

A área cortical que recobre a ínsula em direção à superfície lateral do cérebro é o opérculo (que significa tampa).

Os opérculos são formados por partes dos lobos frontal, temporal e parietal.


== Estrutura ==


=== Conexões ===

A parte anterior da ínsula é subdividida por sulcos rasos em três ou quatro giros curtos.

A ínsula anterior recebe uma projeção direta da parte basal do núcleo ventral medial do tálamo e uma entrada particularmente grande do núcleo central da amígdala.

Além disso, a própria ínsula anterior projeta-se para a amígdala.

Um estudo em macacos rhesus revelou amplas conexões recíprocas entre o córtex insular e quase todos os subnúcleos do complexo amigdalóide.

A ínsula posterior projeta-se predominantemente para o aspecto dorsal da lateral e para os núcleos amigdalóides centrais.

Em contraste, a ínsula anterior projeta-se para a área amigdalóide anterior, bem como para os núcleos medial, cortical, magnocelular basal acessório, basal medial e amigdalóide lateral.

A parte posterior da ínsula é formada por um giro longo.

A ínsula posterior conecta-se reciprocamente com o córtex somatossensorial secundário e recebe aferências dos núcleos talâmicos ventrais póstero-inferiores ativados espinotalamicamente.

Também foi demonstrado que esta região recebe entradas do núcleo ventromedial (parte posterior) do tálamo que são altamente especializados para transmitir informações homeostáticas como dor, temperatura, coceira, status de oxigênio local e toque sensual.

Um estudo de neuroimagem humana usando imagens de tensor de difusão revelou que a ínsula anterior está interconectada a regiões do lobo temporal e occipital, córtex opercular e orbitofrontal, partes triangulares e operculares do giro frontal inferior. 

O mesmo estudo revelou diferenças nos padrões de conexão anatômica entre os hemisférios esquerdo e direito.

O 'sulco circular da ínsula' (ou sulco de Reil) é um sulco ou fissura semicircular que separa a ínsula dos giros vizinhos do opérculo na frente, acima e
atrás.


=== Citoarquitetura ===

O córtex insular possui regiões de estrutura celular ou citoarquitetura variável, passando de granular na porção posterior para agranular na porção anterior. 

A ínsula também recebe aferências corticais e talâmicas diferenciais ao longo de seu comprimento. 

O córtex insular anterior contém uma população de neurônios do fuso (também chamados de neurônios von Economo), identificados como caracterizando uma sub-região distinta como a ínsula frontal agranular.


=== Desenvolvimento ===

O córtex insular é considerado um lobo separado do telencéfalo por algumas autoridades. 

Outras fontes vêem a ínsula como parte do lobo temporal. 

Às vezes, também é agrupado com estruturas límbicas profundas no cérebro em um lobo límbico. 

Como um córtex paralímbico, o córtex insular é considerado uma estrutura relativamente antiga.


== Função ==


=== Processamento sensorial multimodal, ligação sensorial ===

Os estudos de imagem funcional mostram a ativação da ínsula durante as tarefas de integração audiovisual.


=== Gosto ===

A ínsula anterior faz parte do córtex gustativo primário.


=== Consciência interoceptiva ===

Há evidências de que, além de suas funções básicas, a ínsula pode desempenhar um papel em certas funções de nível superior que operam apenas em humanos e outros grandes símios. 

Os neurônios do fuso encontrados em maior densidade no córtex insular frontal direito também são encontrados no córtex cingulado anterior, que é outra região que atingiu um alto nível de especialização em grandes símios. 

Especulou-se que esses neurônios estão envolvidos em processos cognitivo-emocionais específicos de primatas, incluindo grandes símios, como empatia e sentimentos emocionais metacognitivos. 

Isso é apoiado por resultados de imagens funcionais que mostram que a estrutura e a função da ínsula frontal direita estão correlacionadas com a capacidade de sentir o próprio batimento cardíaco ou ter empatia com a dor dos outros. 

Pensa-se que essas funções não são distintas das funções de nível inferior da ínsula, mas surgem como consequência do papel da ínsula na transmissão de informações homeostáticas à consciência.

A ínsula anterior direita está envolvida na percepção interoceptiva das emoções homeostáticas, como sede, dor e fadiga, e na capacidade de cronometrar o próprio batimento cardíaco.

Além disso, maior volume de substância cinzenta insular anterior direita se correlaciona com maior precisão nesse sentido subjetivo do corpo interno e com experiência emocional negativa.

Também está envolvido no controle da pressão arterial, em particular durante e após o exercício, e sua atividade varia com a quantidade de esforço que a pessoa acredita estar exercendo.

O córtex insular também é onde a sensação de dor é julgada quanto ao seu grau.

Além disso, a ínsula é onde uma pessoa imagina a dor ao olhar para imagens de eventos dolorosos enquanto pensa em seu próprio corpo.

Aqueles com síndrome do intestino irritável têm processamento anormal da dor visceral no córtex insular relacionado à inibição disfuncional da dor dentro do cérebro. Outra percepção da ínsula anterior direita é o grau de calor não doloroso ou frieza não dolorosa de uma sensação cutânea.

Outras sensações internas processadas pela ínsula incluem distensão estomacal ou abdominal.

Uma bexiga cheia também ativa o córtex insular. Um estudo de imagem cerebral sugere que o desconforto da dispnéia percebida subjetivamente é processado na ínsula anterior humana direita e na amígdala.

O córtex cerebral processando as sensações vestibulares se estende até a ínsula, com pequenas lesões no córtex insular anterior podendo causar perda de equilíbrio e vertigem.

Outras percepções não interoceptivas incluem ouvir música passivamente, rir e chorar, empatia e compaixão e linguagem.


=== Controle do motor ===

No controle motor, contribui para o movimento motor da mão e do olho, deglutição, motilidade gástrica e articulação da fala.

Foi identificado como um centro de "comando central" que garante que a frequência cardíaca e a pressão arterial aumentem no início do exercício.

A pesquisa sobre a conversação vincula-a à capacidade de frases faladas longas e complexas.

Também está envolvido no aprendizado motor e foi identificado como desempenhando um papel na recuperação motora do acidente vascular cerebral.


=== Homeostase ===

Desempenha um papel em uma variedade de funções homeostáticas relacionadas às necessidades básicas de sobrevivência, como paladar, sensação visceral e controle autonômico.

A ínsula controla as funções autonômicas através da regulação dos sistemas simpático e parassimpático.

Tem um papel na regulação do sistema imunológico.


=== Próprio ===

A ínsula foi identificada como desempenhando um papel na experiência de autoconsciência corporal, senso de agência e senso de propriedade do corpo.


=== Emoções sociais ===

A ínsula anterior processa a sensação de desgosto de uma pessoa tanto pelos cheiros quanto pela visão de contaminação e mutilação – mesmo quando apenas imaginando a experiência.

Isso se associa a uma ligação semelhante a um neurônio-espelho entre experiências externas e internas.

Na experiência social, está envolvida no processamento de violações de normas, processamento emocional, empatia e orgasmos. A ínsula está ativa durante a tomada de decisões sociais.

Tiziana Quarto et al. mediram a inteligência emocional (IE) (a capacidade de identificar, regular e processar emoções de si e dos outros) de sessenta e três indivíduos saudáveis.

Usando fMRI EI foi medido em correlação com a atividade insular esquerda.

Os sujeitos receberam várias fotos de expressões faciais e tiveram a tarefa de decidir se aproximar ou evitar a pessoa na foto.

Os resultados da tarefa de decisão social revelaram que indivíduos com altos escores de IE deixaram a ativação insular ao processar rostos de medo.

Indivíduos com baixos escores de IE apresentaram ativação insular esquerda ao processar rostos zangados.


=== Emoções ===

O córtex insular, em particular sua porção mais anterior, é considerado um córtex límbico.

A ínsula tem se tornado cada vez mais o foco de atenção por seu papel na representação do corpo e na experiência emocional subjetiva.

Em particular, Antonio Damásio propôs que essa região desempenha um papel no mapeamento de estados viscerais que estão associados à experiência emocional, dando origem a sentimentos conscientes.

Esta é, em essência, uma formulação neurobiológica das idéias de William James, que primeiro propôs que a experiência emocional subjetiva (isto é, sentimentos) surge da interpretação do nosso cérebro de estados corporais que são provocados por eventos emocionais.

Este é um exemplo de cognição incorporada.
Em termos de função, acredita-se que a ínsula processe informações convergentes para produzir um contexto emocionalmente relevante para a experiência sensorial.

Especificamente, a ínsula anterior está mais relacionada à função olfativa, gustativa, viscero-autonômica e límbica, enquanto a ínsula posterior está mais relacionada à função auditivo-somestésica-esqueletomotora. 

Experimentos de imagens funcionais revelaram que a ínsula tem um papel importante na experiência da dor e na experiência de uma série de emoções básicas, incluindo raiva, medo, nojo, felicidade e tristeza. sentimentos emocionais, incluindo amor materno e romântico, raiva, medo, tristeza, felicidade, excitação sexual, desgosto, aversão, injustiça, iniquidade, indignação, incerteza, descrença, exclusão social, confiança, empatia, beleza escultural, um 'estado de união com Deus', e estados alucinógenos.

Estudos de imagens funcionais também implicaram a ínsula em desejos conscientes, como desejo por comida e desejo por drogas. 

O que é comum a todos esses estados emocionais é que cada um deles muda o corpo de alguma forma e está associado a qualidades subjetivas altamente salientes. 

A ínsula está bem situada para a integração de informações relacionadas a estados corporais em processos cognitivos e emocionais de ordem superior. 

A ínsula recebe informações de vias sensoriais "aferentes homeostáticas" através do tálamo e envia informações para várias outras estruturas relacionadas ao límbico, como a amígdala, o corpo estriado ventral e o córtex orbitofrontal, bem como para os córtices motores.

Um estudo usando ressonância magnética descobriu que a ínsula anterior direita é significativamente mais espessa em pessoas que meditam. 

Outras pesquisas sobre atividade cerebral e meditação mostraram um aumento na massa cinzenta em áreas do cérebro, incluindo o córtex insular.

Outro estudo usando morfometria baseada em voxel e ressonância magnética em meditadores experientes de Vipassana foi feito para estender as descobertas de Lazar et al., que encontraram concentrações aumentadas de matéria cinzenta nesta e em outras áreas do cérebro em meditadores experientes.

A evidência mais forte contra um papel causal do córtex insular na emoção vem de Damásio et al. (2012) que mostrou que um paciente que sofreu lesões bilaterais do córtex da ínsula expressou todo o complemento das emoções humanas e foi totalmente capaz de aprendizado emocional.


=== Saliência ===

A pesquisa de neuroimagem funcional sugere que a ínsula está envolvida em dois tipos de saliência. 

Processamento de informação interoceptiva que liga a interocepção com a saliência emocional para gerar uma representação subjetiva do corpo. 

Isso envolve, primeiro, o córtex insular anterior com o córtex cingulado anterior pré-genual (área 33 de Brodmann) e os córtices cingulado médio anterior e posterior e, segundo, uma rede de saliência geral relacionada ao monitoramento ambiental, seleção de respostas e orientação do corpo esqueletomotor. que envolve todo o córtex insular e o córtex cingulado médio.

Uma proposta alternativa ou talvez complementar é que a insular anterior direita regule a interação entre a saliência da atenção seletiva criada para realizar uma tarefa (o sistema de atenção dorsal) e a saliência da excitação criada para manter o foco na parte relevante do ambiente ( sistema de atenção ventral). 

Essa regulação da saliência pode ser particularmente importante durante tarefas desafiadoras, onde a atenção pode cansar e causar erros por descuido, mas se houver muita excitação, corre o risco de criar um desempenho ruim, transformando-se em ansiedade.


=== Percepção auditiva ===

Pesquisas recentes indicam que o córtex insular está envolvido na percepção auditiva. 

As respostas aos estímulos sonoros foram obtidas por meio de registros de EEG intracranianos adquiridos de pacientes com epilepsia. 

A parte posterior da ínsula apresentou respostas auditivas semelhantes às observadas no giro de Heschl, enquanto a parte anterior respondeu aos conteúdos emocionais dos estímulos auditivos.

Gravações diretas da parte posterior da ínsula mostraram respostas a sons inesperados dentro de fluxos auditivos regulares, um processo conhecido como detecção de desvio auditivo. 

Os pesquisadores observaram um potencial de negatividade de incompatibilidade (MMN), um potencial relacionado a eventos bem conhecido, bem como os sinais de atividade de alta frequência originados de neurônios locais.

Simples ilusões auditivas e alucinações foram eliciadas pelo mapeamento elétrico funcional.


== Significado clínico ==


=== Afasia expressiva progressiva ===

A afasia expressiva progressiva é a deterioração da função normal da linguagem que faz com que os indivíduos percam a capacidade de se comunicar fluentemente enquanto ainda são capazes de compreender palavras isoladas e intactas outras cognições não linguísticas.

É encontrado em uma variedade de condições neurológicas degenerativas, incluindo doença de Pick, doença do neurônio motor, degeneração corticobasal, demência frontotemporal e doença de Alzheimer.

Está associada a hipometabolismo e atrofia do córtex insular anterior esquerdo.


=== Vício ===

Vários estudos de imagens funcionais do cérebro mostraram que o córtex insular é ativado quando os usuários de drogas são expostos a estímulos ambientais que desencadeiam desejos. 

Isso foi demonstrado para uma variedade de drogas, incluindo cocaína, álcool, opiáceos e nicotina. 

Apesar desses achados, a ínsula tem sido ignorada na literatura sobre dependência de drogas, talvez porque não se saiba que ela seja um alvo direto do sistema de dopamina mesocortical, que é central para as atuais teorias de recompensa de dopamina da dependência. 

Uma pesquisa publicada em 2007 mostrou que fumantes de cigarros que sofrem danos no córtex insular, por um acidente vascular cerebral, por exemplo, têm o vício do cigarro praticamente eliminado. 

Esses indivíduos foram até 136 vezes mais propensos a sofrer uma interrupção do vício em fumar do que os fumantes com danos em outras áreas. 

A interrupção do vício foi evidenciada por mudanças de comportamento autorrelatadas, como parar de fumar menos de um dia após a lesão cerebral, parar de fumar com grande facilidade, não fumar novamente após parar e não ter vontade de voltar a fumar desde que parou. 

O estudo foi realizado em média oito anos após os derrames, o que abre a possibilidade de que o viés de memória possa ter afetado os resultados. 

Estudos prospectivos mais recentes, que superam essa limitação, corroboram esses achados.

Isso sugere um papel significativo para o córtex insular nos mecanismos neurológicos subjacentes à dependência de nicotina e outras drogas, e tornaria essa área do cérebro um possível alvo para novos medicamentos anti-dependência.

Além disso, esse achado sugere que as funções mediadas pela ínsula, especialmente os sentimentos conscientes, podem ser particularmente importantes para a manutenção da dependência de drogas, embora essa visão não esteja representada em nenhuma pesquisa ou revisão moderna sobre o assunto.

Um estudo recente em ratos por Contreras et al. corrobora esses achados ao mostrar que a inativação reversível da ínsula interrompe a preferência de lugar condicionada por anfetaminas, um modelo animal de desejo por drogas induzido por estímulo.

Neste estudo, a inativação da ínsula também interrompeu as respostas de "mal-estar" à injeção de cloreto de lítio, sugerindo que a representação de estados interoceptivos negativos pela ínsula desempenha um papel no vício. 

No entanto, neste mesmo estudo, a preferência condicionada do local ocorreu imediatamente após a injeção de anfetamina, sugerindo que são os efeitos interoceptivos imediatos e prazerosos da administração de anfetamina, e não os efeitos aversivos e retardados da retirada de anfetamina que são representados dentro da ínsula .

Um modelo proposto por Naqvi et al. (veja acima) é que a ínsula armazena uma representação dos efeitos interoceptivos prazerosos do uso de drogas (p. associados ao uso de drogas.

Vários estudos de imagem funcional mostraram que a ínsula é ativada durante a administração de drogas psicoativas viciantes.

Vários estudos de imagem funcional também mostraram que a ínsula é ativada quando os usuários de drogas são expostos a estímulos de drogas e que essa atividade está correlacionada com impulsos subjetivos.

Nos estudos de exposição a pistas, a atividade da ínsula é desencadeada quando não há mudança real no nível da droga no corpo.

Portanto, em vez de meramente representar os efeitos interoceptivos do uso de drogas à medida que ocorrem, a ínsula pode desempenhar um papel na memória dos efeitos interoceptivos prazerosos do uso passado de drogas, antecipação desses efeitos no futuro ou ambos. 

Tal representação pode dar origem a impulsos conscientes que parecem surgir de dentro do corpo. 

Isso pode fazer com que os viciados sintam que seus corpos precisam usar uma droga e podem resultar em pessoas com lesões na ínsula relatando que seus corpos esqueceram o desejo de usar, de acordo com este estudo.


=== Certeza subjetiva em crises extáticas ===

Uma qualidade comum nas experiências místicas é um forte sentimento de certeza que não pode ser expresso em palavras. 

Fabienne Picard propõe uma explicação neurológica para essa certeza subjetiva, baseada na pesquisa clínica da epilepsia. 

Segundo Picard, esse sentimento de certeza pode ser causado por uma disfunção da ínsula anterior, uma parte do cérebro que está envolvida na interocepção, na autorreflexão e em evitar a incerteza sobre as representações internas do mundo pela "antecipação da resolução de incerteza ou risco".

Essa prevenção da incerteza funciona por meio da comparação entre estados previstos e estados reais, ou seja, "sinalizando que não entendemos, ou seja, que há ambiguidade".

Picard observa que "o conceito de insight é muito próximo ao de certeza", e se refere ao "Eureka!" de Arquimedes. Picard levanta a hipótese de que durante as crises extáticas a comparação entre os estados previstos e os estados reais não funciona mais, e que as incompatibilidades entre o estado previsto e o estado real não são mais processadas, bloqueando "emoções negativas e excitação negativa decorrentes da incerteza preditiva", que serão experimentadas como confiança emocional.

Picard conclui que "isso pode levar a uma interpretação espiritual em alguns indivíduos".


=== Outras condições clínicas ===

O córtex insular tem sido sugerido como tendo um papel nos transtornos de ansiedade, desregulação emocional e anorexia nervosa.


== História ==

A ínsula foi descrita pela primeira vez por Johann Christian Reil ao descrever os nervos e plexos cranianos e espinhais. 

Henry Gray em Grey's Anatomy é responsável por ser conhecida como a Ilha de Reil. 

John Allman e colegas mostraram que o córtex insular anterior contém neurônios do fuso.
