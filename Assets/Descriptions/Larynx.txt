LARYNX


The larynx (), commonly called the voice box, is an organ in the top of the neck involved in breathing, producing sound and protecting the trachea against food aspiration. 

The opening of larynx into pharynx known as the laryngeal inlet is about 4–5 centimeters in diameter. 

The larynx houses the vocal cords, and manipulates pitch and volume, which is essential for phonation. 

It is situated just below where the tract of the pharynx splits into the trachea and the esophagus. 

The word larynx (plural larynges) comes from a similar Ancient Greek word (λάρυγξ lárynx).


== Structure ==


The triangle-shaped larynx consists largely of cartilages that are attached to one another, and to surrounding structures, by muscles or by fibrous and elastic tissue components. 

The larynx is lined by a ciliated columnar epithelium except for the vocal folds. 

The cavity of the larynx extends from its triangle-shaped inlet, to the epiglottis, and to the circular outlet at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, where it is continuous with the lumen of the trachea. 

The mucous membrane lining the larynx forms two pairs of lateral folds that project inward into its cavity. 

The upper folds are called the vestibular folds. 

They are also sometimes called the false vocal cords for the rather obvious reason that they play no part in vocalization. 

The lower pair of folds are known as the vocal cords, which produce sounds needed for speech and other vocalizations. 

The slit-like space between the left and right vocal cords, called the rima glottidis, is the narrowest part of the larynx. 

The vocal cords and the rima glottidis are together designated as the glottis. 

The laryngeal cavity above the vestibular folds is called the vestibule. 

The very middle portion of the cavity between the vestibular folds and the vocal cords is the ventricle of the larynx, or laryngeal ventricle. 

The infraglottic cavity is the open space below the glottis.


=== Location ===

In adult humans, the larynx is found in the anterior neck at the level of the cervical vertebrae C3–C6. 

It connects the inferior part of the pharynx (hypopharynx) with the trachea. 

The laryngeal skeleton consists of nine cartilages: three single (epiglottic, thyroid and cricoid) and three paired (arytenoid, corniculate, and cuneiform). 

The hyoid bone is not part of the larynx, though the larynx is suspended from the hyoid. 

The larynx extends vertically from the tip of the epiglottis to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage. 

Its interior can be divided in supraglottis, glottis and subglottis.


=== Cartilages ===


There are nine cartilages, three unpaired and three paired (3 pairs=6), that support the mammalian larynx and form its skeleton.

Unpaired cartilages:

Thyroid cartilage: 
    This forms the Adam's apple (also called the laryngeal prominence). 

It is usually larger in males than in females. 

The thyrohyoid membrane is a ligament associated with the thyroid cartilage that connects it with the hyoid bone. 

It supports the front portion of the larynx.

Cricoid cartilage: 
    A ring of hyaline cartilage that forms the inferior wall of the larynx. 

It is attached to the top of the trachea. 

The median cricothyroid ligament connects the cricoid cartilage to the thyroid cartilage.

Epiglottis: 
    A large, spoon-shaped piece of elastic cartilage. 

During swallowing, the pharynx and larynx rise. 

Elevation of the pharynx widens it to receive food and drink; elevation of the larynx causes the epiglottis to move down and form a lid over the glottis, closing it off.

Paired cartilages:

Arytenoid cartilages: 
    Of the paired cartilages, the arytenoid cartilages are the most important because they influence the position and tension of the vocal cords. 

These are triangular pieces of mostly hyaline cartilage located at the posterosuperior border of the cricoid cartilage.

Corniculate cartilages: 
    Horn-shaped pieces of elastic cartilage located at the apex of each arytenoid cartilage.
    
Cuneiform cartilages: 
    Club-shaped pieces of elastic cartilage located anterior to the corniculate cartilages.


=== Muscles ===

The muscles of the larynx are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. 

The extrinsic muscles act on the region and pass between the larynx and parts around it but have their origin elsewhere; the intrinsic muscles are confined entirely within the larynx and have their origin and insertion there.

The intrinsic muscles are divided into respiratory and the phonatory muscles (the muscles of phonation). 

The respiratory muscles move the vocal cords apart and serve breathing. 

The phonatory muscles move the vocal cords together and serve the production of voice. 

The main respiratory muscles are the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. 

The phonatory muscles are divided into adductors (lateral cricoarytenoid muscles, arytenoid muscles) and tensors (cricothyroid muscles, thyroarytenoid muscles).


==== Intrinsic ====
The intrinsic laryngeal muscles are responsible for controlling sound production.

Cricothyroid muscle lengthen and tense the vocal cords.

Posterior cricoarytenoid muscles abduct and externally rotate the arytenoid cartilages, resulting in abducted vocal cords.

Lateral cricoarytenoid muscles adduct and internally rotate the arytenoid cartilages, increase medial compression.

Transverse arytenoid muscle adduct the arytenoid cartilages, resulting in adducted vocal cords.

Oblique arytenoid muscles narrow the laryngeal inlet by constricting the distance between the arytenoid cartilages.

Thyroarytenoid muscles narrow the laryngeal inlet, shortening the vocal cords, and lowering voice pitch. 

The internal thyroarytenoid is the portion of the thyroarytenoid that vibrates to produce sound.Notably the only muscle capable of separating the vocal cords for normal breathing is the posterior cricoarytenoid. 

If this muscle is incapacitated on both sides, the inability to pull the vocal cords apart (abduct) will cause difficulty breathing. 

Bilateral injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve would cause this condition. 

It is also worth noting that all muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus except the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (a branch of the vagus).

Additionally, intrinsic laryngeal muscles present a constitutive Ca2+-buffering profile that predicts their better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles. 

This profile is in agreement with their function as very fast muscles with a well-developed capacity for prolonged work. 

Studies suggests that mechanisms involved in the prompt sequestering of Ca2+ (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-reuptake proteins, plasma membrane pumps, and cytosolic Ca2+-buffering proteins) are particularly elevated in laryngeal muscles, indicating their importance for the myofiber function and protection against disease, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 

Furthermore, different levels of Orai1 in rat intrinsic laryngeal muscles and extraocular muscles over the limb muscle suggests a role for store operated calcium entry channels in those muscles' functional properties and signaling mechanisms.


==== Extrinsic ====

The extrinsic laryngeal muscles support and position the larynx within the mid-cervical region. [trachea.]

-Sternothyroid muscles depress the larynx. (Innervated by ansa cervicalis)
-Omohyoid muscles depress the larynx. (Ansa cervicalis)
-Sternohyoid muscles depress the larynx. (Ansa cervicalis)
-Inferior constrictor muscles. (CN X)
-Thyrohyoid muscles elevates the larynx. (C1)
-Digastric elevates the larynx. (CN V3, CN VII)
-Stylohyoid elevates the larynx. (CN VII)
-Mylohyoid elevates the larynx. (CN V3)
-Geniohyoid elevates the larynx. (C1)
-Hyoglossus elevates the larynx. (CN XII)
-Genioglossus elevates the larynx. (CN XII)


=== Nerve supply ===

The larynx is innervated by branches of the vagus nerve on each side. 

Sensory innervation to the glottis and laryngeal vestibule is by the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. 

The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle. 

Motor innervation to all other muscles of the larynx and sensory innervation to the subglottis is by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. 

While the sensory input described above is (general) visceral sensation (diffuse, poorly localized), the vocal cords also receives general somatic sensory innervation (proprioceptive and touch) by the superior laryngeal nerve.

Injury to the external laryngeal nerve causes weakened phonation because the vocal cords cannot be tightened. 

Injury to one of the recurrent laryngeal nerves produces hoarseness, if both are damaged the voice may or may not be preserved, but breathing becomes difficult.


=== Development ===

In newborn infants, the larynx is initially at the level of the C2–C3 vertebrae, and is further forward and higher relative to its position in the adult body. 

The larynx descends as the child grows.


== Function ==

=== Sound generation ===

Sound is generated in the larynx, and that is where pitch and volume are manipulated. 

The strength of expiration from the lungs also contributes to loudness.

Manipulation of the larynx is used to generate a source sound with a particular fundamental frequency, or pitch. 

This source sound is altered as it travels through the vocal tract, configured differently based on the position of the tongue, lips, mouth, and pharynx. 

The process of altering a source sound as it passes through the filter of the vocal tract creates the many different vowel and consonant sounds of the world's languages as well as tone, certain realizations of stress and other types of linguistic prosody. 

The larynx also has a similar function to the lungs in creating pressure differences required for sound production; a constricted larynx can be raised or lowered affecting the volume of the oral cavity as necessary in glottalic consonants.

The vocal cords can be held close together (by adducting the arytenoid cartilages) so that they vibrate (see phonation). 

The muscles attached to the arytenoid cartilages control the degree of opening. 

Vocal cord length and tension can be controlled by rocking the thyroid cartilage forward and backward on the cricoid cartilage (either directly by contracting the cricothyroids or indirectly by changing the vertical position of the larynx), by manipulating the tension of the muscles within the vocal cords, and by moving the arytenoids forward or backward. 

This causes the pitch produced during phonation to rise or fall. 

In most males the vocal cords are longer and with a greater mass than most females' vocal cords, producing a lower pitch.

The vocal apparatus consists of two pairs of folds, the vestibular folds (false vocal cords) and the true vocal cords. 

The vestibular folds are covered by respiratory epithelium, while the vocal cords are covered by stratified squamous epithelium. 

The vestibular folds are not responsible for sound production, but rather for resonance. 

The exceptions to this are found in Tibetan chanting and Kargyraa, a style of Tuvan throat singing. 

Both make use of the vestibular folds to create an undertone. 

These false vocal cords do not contain muscle, while the true vocal cords do have skeletal muscle.


=== Other ===


The most important role of the larynx is its protecting function; the prevention of foreign objects from entering the lungs by coughing and other reflexive actions. 

A cough is initiated by a deep inhalation through the vocal cords, followed by the elevation of the larynx and the tight adduction (closing) of the vocal cords. 

The forced expiration that follows, assisted by tissue recoil and the muscles of expiration, blows the vocal cords apart, and the high pressure expels the irritating object out of the throat. 

Throat clearing is less violent than coughing, but is a similar increased respiratory effort countered by the tightening of the laryngeal musculature. 

Both coughing and throat clearing are predictable and necessary actions because they clear the respiratory passageway, but both place the vocal cords under significant strain.

Another important role of the larynx is abdominal fixation, a kind of Valsalva maneuver in which the lungs are filled with air in order to stiffen the thorax so that forces applied for lifting can be translated down to the legs. 

This is achieved by a deep inhalation followed by the adduction of the vocal cords. 

Grunting while lifting heavy objects is the result of some air escaping through the adducted vocal cords ready for phonation.

Abduction of the vocal cords is important during physical exertion. 

The vocal cords are separated by about 8 mm (0.31 in) during normal respiration, but this width is doubled during forced respiration.

During swallowing, elevation of the posterior portion of the tongue levers (inverts) the epiglottis over the glottis' opening to prevent swallowed material from entering the larynx which leads to the lungs, and provides a path for a food or liquid bolus to "slide" into the esophagus; the hyo-laryngeal complex is also pulled upwards to assist this process. 

Stimulation of the larynx by aspirated food or liquid produces a strong cough reflex to protect the lungs.

In addition, intrinsic laryngeal muscles are spared from some muscle wasting disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, may facilitate the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in a variety of clinical scenarios. 

ILM have a calcium regulation system profile suggestive of a better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles, and this may provide a mechanistic insight for their unique pathophysiological properties


== Clinical significance ==

=== Disorders ===


There are several things that can cause a larynx to not function properly. 

Some symptoms are hoarseness, loss of voice, pain in the throat or ears, and breathing difficulties. 

Acute laryngitis is the sudden inflammation and swelling of the larynx. 

It is caused by the common cold or by excessive shouting. 

It is not serious. 

Chronic laryngitis is caused by smoking, dust, frequent yelling, or prolonged exposure to polluted air. 

It is much more serious than acute laryngitis.

Presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related atrophy of the soft tissues of the larynx results in weak voice and restricted vocal range and stamina. 

Bowing of the anterior portion of the vocal colds is found on laryngoscopy.

Ulcers may be caused by the prolonged presence of an endotracheal tube.

Polyps and vocal cord nodules are small bumps caused by prolonged exposure to tobacco smoke and vocal misuse, respectively.

Two related types of cancer of the larynx, namely squamous cell carcinoma and verrucous carcinoma, are strongly associated with repeated exposure to cigarette smoke and alcohol.

Vocal cord paresis is weakness of one or both vocal cords that can greatly impact daily life.

Idiopathic laryngeal spasm.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux is a condition in which acid from the stomach irritates and burns the larynx. 

Similar damage can occur with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Laryngomalacia is a very common condition of infancy, in which the soft, immature cartilage of the upper larynx collapses inward during inhalation, causing airway obstruction.

Laryngeal perichondritis, the inflammation of the perichondrium of laryngeal cartilages, causing airway obstruction.

Laryngeal paralysis is a condition seen in some mammals (including dogs) in which the larynx no longer opens as wide as required for the passage of air, and impedes respiration. 

In mild cases it can lead to exaggerated or "raspy" breathing or panting, and in serious cases can pose a considerable need for treatment.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy, intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILM) are spared from the lack of dystrophin and may serve as a useful model to study the mechanisms of muscle sparing in neuromuscular diseases. 

Dystrophic ILM presented a significant increase in the expression of calcium-binding proteins. 

The increase of calcium-binding proteins in dystrophic ILM may permit better maintenance of calcium homeostasis, with the consequent absence of myonecrosis. 

The results further support the concept that abnormal calcium buffering is involved in these neuromuscular diseases.


== Treatments ==

Patients who have lost the use of their larynx are typically prescribed the use of an electrolarynx device. 

Larynx transplants are a rare procedure. 

The world's first successful operation took place in 1998 at the Cleveland Clinic, and the second took place in October 2010 at the University of California Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.


== Other animals ==


Pioneering work on the structure and evolution of the larynx was carried out in the 1920s by the British comparative anatomist Victor Negus, culminating in his monumental work The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929). 

Negus, however, pointed out that the descent of the larynx reflected the reshaping and descent of the human tongue into the pharynx. 

This process is not complete until age six to eight years. 

Some researchers, such as Philip Lieberman, Dennis Klatt, Bart de Boer and Kenneth Stevens using computer-modeling techniques have suggested that the species-specific human tongue allows the vocal tract (the airway above the larynx) to assume the shapes necessary to produce speech sounds that enhance the robustness of human speech. 

Sounds such as the vowels of the words see and do, [i] and [u], (in phonetic notation) have been shown to be less subject to confusion in classic studies such as the 1950 Peterson and Barney investigation of the possibilities for computerized speech recognition.

In contrast, though other species have low larynges, their tongues remain anchored in their mouths and their vocal tracts cannot produce the range of speech sounds of humans. 

The ability to lower the larynx transiently in some species extends the length of their vocal tract, which as Fitch showed creates the acoustic illusion that they are larger. 

Research at Haskins Laboratories in the 1960s showed that speech allows humans to achieve a vocal communication rate that exceeds the fusion frequency of the auditory system by fusing sounds together into syllables and words. 

The additional speech sounds that the human tongue enables us to produce, particularly [i], allow humans to unconsciously infer the length of the vocal tract of the person who is talking, a critical element in recovering the phonemes that make up a word.


=== Non-mammals ===

Most tetrapod species possess a larynx, but its structure is typically simpler than that found in mammals. 

The cartilages surrounding the larynx are apparently a remnant of the original gill arches in fish, and are a common feature, but not all are always present. 

For example, the thyroid cartilage is found only in mammals. 

Similarly, only mammals possess a true epiglottis, although a flap of non-cartilagenous mucosa is found in a similar position in many other groups. 

In modern amphibians, the laryngeal skeleton is considerably reduced; frogs have only the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages, while salamanders possess only the arytenoids.Vocal folds are found only in mammals, and a few lizards. 

As a result, many reptiles and amphibians are essentially voiceless; frogs use ridges in the trachea to modulate sound, while birds have a separate sound-producing organ, the syrinx.


== History ==

The ancient Greek physician Galen first described the larynx, describing it as the "first and supremely most important instrument of the voice".

LARINGE


La laringe (), comúnmente llamada caja de la voz, es un órgano en la parte superior del cuello involucrado en la respiración, produciendo sonido y protegiendo la tráquea contra la aspiración de alimentos. 

La abertura de la laringe hacia la faringe conocida como entrada laríngea tiene aproximadamente 4 a 5 centímetros de diámetro. 

La laringe alberga las cuerdas vocales y manipula el tono y el volumen, lo cual es esencial para la fonación. 

Está situado justo debajo de donde el tracto de la faringe se divide en la tráquea y el esófago. 

La palabra laringe (plural larynges) proviene de una palabra griega antigua similar (λάρυγξ lárynx).


== Estructura ==


La laringe en forma de triángulo consta en gran parte de cartílagos que están unidos entre sí y a las estructuras circundantes por músculos o por componentes de tejido fibroso y elástico. 

La laringe está revestida por un epitelio cilíndrico ciliado a excepción de las cuerdas vocales. 

La cavidad de la laringe se extiende desde su entrada en forma de triángulo hasta la epiglotis y la salida circular en el borde inferior del cartílago cricoides, donde se continúa con la luz de la tráquea. 

La membrana mucosa que recubre la laringe forma dos pares de pliegues laterales que se proyectan hacia el interior de su cavidad. 

Los pliegues superiores se denominan pliegues vestibulares. 

A veces también se les llama cuerdas vocales falsas por la razón bastante obvia de que no juegan ningún papel en la vocalización. 

El par de pliegues inferiores se conocen como cuerdas vocales, que producen los sonidos necesarios para el habla y otras vocalizaciones. 

El espacio en forma de hendidura entre las cuerdas vocales izquierda y derecha, llamado rima glottidis, es la parte más estrecha de la laringe. 

Las cuerdas vocales y la rima glottidis se designan juntas como la glotis. 

La cavidad laríngea por encima de los pliegues vestibulares se llama vestíbulo. 

La porción muy media de la cavidad entre los pliegues vestibulares y las cuerdas vocales es el ventrículo de la laringe o ventrículo laríngeo. 

La cavidad infraglótica es el espacio abierto debajo de la glotis.


=== Ubicación ===

En humanos adultos, la laringe se encuentra en la parte anterior del cuello al nivel de las vértebras cervicales C3-C6. 

Conecta la parte inferior de la faringe (hipofaringe) con la tráquea. 

El esqueleto laríngeo consta de nueve cartílagos: tres simples (epiglótico, tiroides y cricoides) y tres pares (aritenoides, corniculado y cuneiforme). 

El hueso hioides no forma parte de la laringe, aunque la laringe está suspendida del hioides. 

La laringe se extiende verticalmente desde la punta de la epiglotis hasta el borde inferior del cartílago cricoides. 

Su interior se puede dividir en supraglotis, glotis y subglotis.


=== Cartílagos ===


Hay nueve cartílagos, tres no apareados y tres apareados (3 pares = 6), que sostienen la laringe de los mamíferos y forman su esqueleto.

Cartílagos no apareados:

Cartílago tiroideo: 
 Esto forma la nuez de Adán (también llamada prominencia laríngea). 

Suele ser más grande en los machos que en las hembras. 

La membrana tirohioidea es un ligamento asociado con el cartílago tiroides que lo conecta con el hueso hioides. 

Sostiene la porción frontal de la laringe.

Cartílago cricoides: 
 Anillo de cartílago hialino que forma la pared inferior de la laringe. 

Está unido a la parte superior de la tráquea. 

El ligamento cricotiroideo mediano conecta el cartílago cricoides con el cartílago tiroides.

Epiglotis: 
 Una gran pieza de cartílago elástico en forma de cuchara. 

Durante la deglución, la faringe y la laringe se elevan. 

La elevación de la faringe la ensancha para recibir comida y bebida; la elevación de la laringe hace que la epiglotis se mueva hacia abajo y forme una tapa sobre la glotis, cerrándola.

Cartílagos emparejados:

Cartílagos aritenoides: 
De los cartílagos pares, los cartílagos aritenoides son los más importantes porque influyen en la posición y tensión de las cuerdas vocales.

Estas son piezas triangulares de cartílago hialino en su mayoría ubicadas en el borde posterosuperior del cartílago cricoides.

Cartílagos corniculados:
Piezas de cartílago elástico en forma de cuerno ubicadas en el vértice de cada cartílago aritenoides.
 
Cartílagos cuneiformes:
Piezas de cartílago elástico en forma de maza situadas por delante de los cartílagos corniculados.


=== Músculos ===

Los músculos de la laringe se dividen en músculos intrínsecos y extrínsecos. 

Los músculos extrínsecos actúan sobre la región y pasan entre la laringe y las partes que la rodean, pero tienen su origen en otra parte; los músculos intrínsecos están confinados por completo dentro de la laringe y tienen su origen e inserción allí.

Los músculos intrínsecos se dividen en músculos respiratorios y fonatorios (los músculos de la fonación). 

Los músculos respiratorios separan las cuerdas vocales y sirven para la respiración. 

Los músculos fonatorios juntan las cuerdas vocales y sirven para la producción de la voz. 

Los principales músculos respiratorios son los músculos cricoaritenoideos posteriores. 

Los músculos fonatorios se dividen en aductores (músculos cricoaritenoideos laterales, músculos aritenoides) y tensores (músculos cricotiroideos, músculos tiroaritenoideos).


==== Intrínseco ====
Los músculos laríngeos intrínsecos son responsables de controlar la producción de sonido.

El músculo cricotiroideo alarga y tensa las cuerdas vocales.

Los músculos cricoaritenoideos posteriores abducen y rotan externamente los cartílagos aritenoides, lo que provoca la abducción de las cuerdas vocales.

Los músculos cricoaritenoideos laterales aducen y rotan internamente los cartílagos aritenoides, aumentando la compresión medial.

El músculo aritenoides transverso aduce los cartílagos aritenoides, lo que da como resultado la aducción de las cuerdas vocales.

Los músculos aritenoides oblicuos estrechan la entrada de la laringe al contraer la distancia entre los cartílagos aritenoides.

Los músculos tiroaritenoideos estrechan la entrada de la laringe, acortando las cuerdas vocales y bajando el tono de la voz.

El tiroaritenoideo interno es la porción del tiroaritenoideo que vibra para producir sonido. En particular, el único músculo capaz de separar las cuerdas vocales para la respiración normal es el cricoaritenoideo posterior.

Si este músculo está incapacitado en ambos lados, la incapacidad para separar las cuerdas vocales (abducirlas) provocará dificultad para respirar.

La lesión bilateral del nervio laríngeo recurrente causaría esta condición.

También vale la pena señalar que todos los músculos están inervados por la rama laríngea recurrente del nervio vago, excepto el músculo cricotiroideo, que está inervado por la rama laríngea externa del nervio laríngeo superior (una rama del nervio vago).

Además, los músculos laríngeos intrínsecos presentan un perfil amortiguador de Ca2+ constitutivo que predice su mejor capacidad para manejar los cambios de calcio en comparación con otros músculos.

Este perfil está de acuerdo con su función como músculos muy rápidos con una capacidad de trabajo prolongada bien desarrollada.

Los estudios sugieren que los mecanismos involucrados en el rápido secuestro de Ca2+ (proteínas de recaptación de Ca2+ del retículo sarcoplásmico, bombas de membrana plasmática y proteínas amortiguadoras de Ca2+ citosólicas) son particularmente elevados en los músculos laríngeos, lo que indica su importancia para la función de las miofibras y la protección contra enfermedades, como como distrofia muscular de Duchenne. 

Además, los diferentes niveles de Orai1 en los músculos laríngeos intrínsecos de rata y los músculos extraoculares sobre el músculo de la extremidad sugieren un papel para los canales de entrada de calcio operados por el almacén en las propiedades funcionales y los mecanismos de señalización de esos músculos.


==== Extrínseco ====

Los músculos laríngeos extrínsecos sostienen y colocan la laringe dentro de la región cervical media. [tráquea.]

-Los músculos esternotiroideos deprimen la laringe. (Inervado por ansa cervicalis)
-Los músculos omohioideos deprimen la laringe. (Ansa cervicalis)
-Los músculos esternohioideos deprimen la laringe. (Ansa cervicalis)
-Músculos constrictores inferiores. (CN X)
-Los músculos tirohioideos elevan la laringe. (C1)
-Digastric eleva la laringe. (CN V3, CN VII)
-El estilohioideo eleva la laringe. (CN VII)
-Milohioideo eleva la laringe. (CN V3)
- Geniohioideo eleva la laringe. (C1)
-El hiogloso eleva la laringe. (CN XII)
- Genioglossus eleva la laringe. (CN XII)


=== Suministro nervioso ===

La laringe está inervada por ramas del nervio vago a cada lado.

La inervación sensorial de la glotis y el vestíbulo laríngeo proviene de la rama interna del nervio laríngeo superior.

La rama externa del nervio laríngeo superior inerva el músculo cricotiroideo.

La inervación motora de todos los demás músculos de la laringe y la inervación sensorial de la subglotis proviene del nervio laríngeo recurrente.

Si bien la entrada sensorial descrita anteriormente es una sensación visceral (general) (difusa, poco localizada), las cuerdas vocales también reciben inervación sensorial somática general (propioceptiva y táctil) del nervio laríngeo superior.

La lesión del nervio laríngeo externo provoca una fonación debilitada porque las cuerdas vocales no se pueden tensar.

La lesión de uno de los nervios laríngeos recurrentes produce ronquera; si ambos están dañados, la voz puede conservarse o no, pero la respiración se dificulta.


=== Desarrollo ===

En los recién nacidos, la laringe se encuentra inicialmente al nivel de las vértebras C2-C3 y está más adelante y más alta en relación con su posición en el cuerpo adulto.

La laringe desciende a medida que el niño crece.


== Función ==

=== Generación de sonido ===

El sonido se genera en la laringe, y ahí es donde se manipulan el tono y el volumen.

La fuerza de la expiración de los pulmones también contribuye al volumen.

La manipulación de la laringe se usa para generar una fuente de sonido con una frecuencia fundamental o tono particular.

Este sonido de origen se altera a medida que viaja a través del tracto vocal, configurado de manera diferente según la posición de la lengua, los labios, la boca y la faringe.

El proceso de alterar un sonido fuente a medida que pasa a través del filtro del tracto vocal crea los diferentes sonidos de vocales y consonantes de los idiomas del mundo, así como el tono, ciertas realizaciones de acento y otros tipos de prosodia lingüística.

La laringe también tiene una función similar a la de los pulmones al crear las diferencias de presión necesarias para la producción de sonido; una laringe constreñida puede subir o bajar afectando el volumen de la cavidad bucal según sea necesario en las consonantes glóticas.

Las cuerdas vocales se pueden mantener juntas (mediante la aducción de los cartílagos aritenoides) para que vibren (ver fonación). 

Los músculos unidos a los cartílagos aritenoides controlan el grado de apertura. 

La longitud y la tensión de las cuerdas vocales se pueden controlar balanceando el cartílago tiroides hacia adelante y hacia atrás sobre el cartílago cricoides (ya sea directamente contrayendo los cricotiroideos o indirectamente cambiando la posición vertical de la laringe), manipulando la tensión de los músculos dentro de las cuerdas vocales. , y moviendo los aritenoides hacia adelante o hacia atrás. 

Esto hace que el tono producido durante la fonación suba o baje. 

En la mayoría de los hombres, las cuerdas vocales son más largas y con mayor masa que las cuerdas vocales de la mayoría de las mujeres, lo que produce un tono más bajo.

El aparato vocal consta de dos pares de pliegues, los pliegues vestibulares (cuerdas vocales falsas) y las cuerdas vocales verdaderas.

Los pliegues vestibulares están cubiertos por epitelio respiratorio, mientras que las cuerdas vocales están cubiertas por epitelio escamoso estratificado.

Los pliegues vestibulares no son responsables de la producción de sonido, sino de la resonancia.

Las excepciones a esto se encuentran en el canto tibetano y Kargyraa, un estilo de canto de garganta tuvano.

Ambos hacen uso de los pliegues vestibulares para crear un trasfondo.

Estas cuerdas vocales falsas no contienen músculo, mientras que las cuerdas vocales verdaderas tienen músculo esquelético.


=== Otro ===


El papel más importante de la laringe es su función protectora; la prevención de que objetos extraños entren en los pulmones al toser y otras acciones reflejas.

La tos se inicia con una inhalación profunda a través de las cuerdas vocales, seguida de la elevación de la laringe y la aducción (cierre) tensa de las cuerdas vocales. 

La espiración forzada que sigue, asistida por el retroceso del tejido y los músculos de la espiración, rompe las cuerdas vocales y la alta presión expulsa el objeto irritante por la garganta. 

El carraspeo es menos violento que la tos, pero es un aumento similar del esfuerzo respiratorio contrarrestado por la contracción de la musculatura laríngea. 

Tanto toser como carraspear son acciones predecibles y necesarias porque despejan las vías respiratorias, pero ambas ponen las cuerdas vocales bajo una tensión significativa.

Otro papel importante de la laringe es la fijación abdominal, una especie de maniobra de Valsalva en la que los pulmones se llenan de aire para endurecer el tórax de modo que las fuerzas aplicadas para levantar se puedan trasladar a las piernas.

Esto se logra mediante una inhalación profunda seguida de la aducción de las cuerdas vocales.

Los gruñidos al levantar objetos pesados ​​son el resultado de un poco de aire que se escapa a través de las cuerdas vocales en aducción, listo para la fonación.

La abducción de las cuerdas vocales es importante durante el esfuerzo físico.

Las cuerdas vocales están separadas unos 8 mm (0,31 pulgadas) durante la respiración normal, pero este ancho se duplica durante la respiración forzada.

Durante la deglución, la elevación de la porción posterior de la lengua hace palanca (invierte) la epiglotis sobre la abertura de la glotis para evitar que el material deglutido entre en la laringe que conduce a los pulmones y proporciona un camino para que un bolo alimenticio o líquido se "deslice" en el esófago; el complejo hiolaríngeo también se empuja hacia arriba para ayudar en este proceso.

La estimulación de la laringe por alimentos o líquidos aspirados produce un fuerte reflejo de tos para proteger los pulmones.

Además, los músculos laríngeos intrínsecos están libres de algunos trastornos de desgaste muscular, como la distrofia muscular de Duchenne, lo que puede facilitar el desarrollo de estrategias novedosas para la prevención y el tratamiento del desgaste muscular en una variedad de escenarios clínicos. 

La ILM tiene un perfil del sistema de regulación del calcio que sugiere una mejor capacidad para manejar los cambios de calcio en comparación con otros músculos, y esto puede proporcionar una visión mecánica de sus propiedades fisiopatológicas únicas.


== Importancia clínica ==

=== Trastornos ===


Hay varias cosas que pueden hacer que una laringe no funcione correctamente. 

Algunos síntomas son ronquera, pérdida de la voz, dolor de garganta o de oídos y dificultad para respirar. 

La laringitis aguda es la inflamación e hinchazón repentinas de la laringe. 

Es causada por el resfriado común o por el exceso de gritos. 

No es serio. 

La laringitis crónica es causada por fumar, polvo, gritos frecuentes o exposición prolongada al aire contaminado. 

Es mucho más grave que la laringitis aguda.

La presbilaringe es una afección en la que la atrofia de los tejidos blandos de la laringe relacionada con la edad da como resultado una voz débil y un rango vocal y una resistencia restringidos.

El arqueamiento de la porción anterior de los resfriados vocales se encuentra en la laringoscopia.

Las úlceras pueden ser causadas por la presencia prolongada de un tubo endotraqueal.

Los pólipos y los nódulos de las cuerdas vocales son pequeños bultos causados ​​por la exposición prolongada al humo del tabaco y el mal uso de la voz, respectivamente.

Dos tipos relacionados de cáncer de laringe, a saber, el carcinoma de células escamosas y el carcinoma verrugoso, están fuertemente asociados con la exposición repetida al humo del cigarrillo y al alcohol.

La paresia de las cuerdas vocales es la debilidad de una o ambas cuerdas vocales que puede tener un gran impacto en la vida diaria.

Espasmo laríngeo idiopático.

El reflujo laringofaríngeo es una condición en la que el ácido del estómago irrita y quema la laringe.

Se puede producir un daño similar con la enfermedad por reflujo gastroesofágico (ERGE).
La laringomalacia es una afección muy común de la infancia, en la que el cartílago blando e inmaduro de la laringe superior se colapsa hacia adentro durante la inhalación, lo que provoca la obstrucción de las vías respiratorias.

Pericondritis laríngea, la inflamación del pericondrio de los cartílagos laríngeos, que causa obstrucción de las vías respiratorias.

La parálisis laríngea es una afección que se observa en algunos mamíferos (incluidos los perros) en los que la laringe ya no se abre tanto como se requiere para el paso del aire e impide la respiración.

En los casos leves, puede provocar una respiración o un jadeo exagerados o "ásperos", y en los casos graves puede plantear una necesidad considerable de tratamiento.

Distrofia muscular de Duchenne, los músculos laríngeos intrínsecos (ILM) se salvan de la falta de distrofina y pueden servir como un modelo útil para estudiar los mecanismos de preservación muscular en enfermedades neuromusculares.

La MLI distrófica presentó un aumento significativo en la expresión de proteínas fijadoras de calcio.

El aumento de proteínas fijadoras de calcio en la MLI distrófica puede permitir un mejor mantenimiento de la homeostasis del calcio, con la consiguiente ausencia de mionecrosis.

Los resultados respaldan aún más el concepto de que la amortiguación anormal del calcio está involucrada en estas enfermedades neuromusculares.


== Tratamientos ==

A los pacientes que han perdido el uso de su laringe generalmente se les prescribe el uso de un dispositivo de electrolaringe.

Los trasplantes de laringe son un procedimiento raro.

La primera operación exitosa del mundo tuvo lugar en 1998 en la Clínica Cleveland, y la segunda tuvo lugar en octubre de 2010 en el Centro Médico Davis de la Universidad de California en Sacramento.


== Otros animales ==


El trabajo pionero sobre la estructura y evolución de la laringe fue realizado en la década de 1920 por el anatomista comparativo británico Victor Negus, que culminó en su obra monumental El mecanismo de la laringe (1929).

Negus, sin embargo, señaló que el descenso de la laringe reflejaba la remodelación y el descenso de la lengua humana hacia la faringe.

Este proceso no se completa hasta la edad de seis a ocho años.

Algunos investigadores, como Philip Lieberman, Dennis Klatt, Bart de Boer y Kenneth Stevens, utilizando técnicas de modelado por computadora, han sugerido que la lengua humana específica de la especie permite que el tracto vocal (las vías respiratorias por encima de la laringe) asuma las formas necesarias para producir el habla. sonidos que mejoran la robustez del habla humana. 

Se ha demostrado que sonidos como las vocales de las palabras ver y hacer, [i] y [u] (en notación fonética) están menos sujetos a confusión en estudios clásicos como la investigación de Peterson y Barney de 1950 sobre las posibilidades de la computación. reconocimiento de voz.

En contraste, aunque otras especies tienen laringes bajas, sus lenguas permanecen ancladas en sus bocas y sus tractos vocales no pueden producir el rango de sonidos del habla de los humanos. 

La capacidad de bajar la laringe de forma transitoria en algunas especies extiende la longitud de su tracto vocal, lo que, como mostró Fitch, crea la ilusión acústica de que son más grandes.

La investigación en los Laboratorios Haskins en la década de 1960 mostró que el habla permite a los humanos lograr una tasa de comunicación vocal que excede la frecuencia de fusión del sistema auditivo al fusionar sonidos en sílabas y palabras.

Los sonidos del habla adicionales que la lengua humana nos permite producir, particularmente [i], permiten a los humanos inferir inconscientemente la longitud del tracto vocal de la persona que está hablando, un elemento crítico en la recuperación de los fonemas que forman una palabra.


=== No mamíferos ===

La mayoría de las especies de tetrápodos poseen una laringe, pero su estructura suele ser más simple que la que se encuentra en los mamíferos.

Los cartílagos que rodean la laringe son aparentemente un remanente de los arcos branquiales originales en los peces y son una característica común, pero no todos están siempre presentes.

Por ejemplo, el cartílago tiroides se encuentra solo en mamíferos.

Del mismo modo, solo los mamíferos poseen una verdadera epiglotis, aunque en muchos otros grupos se encuentra un colgajo de mucosa no cartilaginosa en una posición similar.

En los anfibios modernos, el esqueleto laríngeo se reduce considerablemente; las ranas tienen solo los cartílagos cricoides y aritenoides, mientras que las salamandras poseen solo los aritenoides. Las cuerdas vocales se encuentran solo en los mamíferos y en algunas lagartijas.

Como resultado, muchos reptiles y anfibios esencialmente no tienen voz; las ranas usan crestas en la tráquea para modular el sonido, mientras que las aves tienen un órgano productor de sonido separado, la siringe.


== Historia ==

El antiguo médico griego Galeno describió por primera vez la laringe, describiéndola como el "primer y más importante instrumento de la voz".

LARYNX


Le larynx (), communément appelé la boîte vocale, est un organe situé dans la partie supérieure du cou impliqué dans la respiration, produisant des sons et protégeant la trachée contre l'aspiration de nourriture. 

L'ouverture du larynx dans le pharynx connue sous le nom d'entrée laryngée mesure environ 4 à 5 centimètres de diamètre. 

Le larynx abrite les cordes vocales et manipule la hauteur et le volume, ce qui est essentiel pour la phonation. 

Il est situé juste en dessous de l'endroit où le tractus pharynx se divise en trachée et œsophage. 

Le mot larynx (pluriel larynges) vient d'un mot grec ancien similaire (λάρυγξ lárynx).


== Structure ==


Le larynx en forme de triangle est constitué en grande partie de cartilages qui sont attachés les uns aux autres et aux structures environnantes, par des muscles ou par des composants de tissus fibreux et élastiques. 

Le larynx est bordé par un épithélium cylindrique cilié à l'exception des cordes vocales. 

La cavité du larynx s'étend de son entrée en forme de triangle à l'épiglotte et à la sortie circulaire au bord inférieur du cartilage cricoïde, où elle est continue avec la lumière de la trachée. 

La membrane muqueuse tapissant le larynx forme deux paires de plis latéraux qui se projettent vers l'intérieur dans sa cavité.

Les plis supérieurs sont appelés plis vestibulaires.

On les appelle aussi parfois les fausses cordes vocales pour la raison plutôt évidente qu'elles ne jouent aucun rôle dans la vocalisation.

La paire inférieure de plis est connue sous le nom de cordes vocales, qui produisent les sons nécessaires à la parole et à d'autres vocalisations.

L'espace en forme de fente entre les cordes vocales gauche et droite, appelé rima glottidis, est la partie la plus étroite du larynx.

Les cordes vocales et la rima glottidis sont désignées ensemble comme la glotte.

La cavité laryngée au-dessus des plis vestibulaires s'appelle le vestibule.

La partie médiane de la cavité entre les plis vestibulaires et les cordes vocales est le ventricule du larynx, ou ventricule laryngé.

La cavité sous-glottique est l'espace ouvert sous la glotte.


=== Emplacement ===

Chez l'homme adulte, le larynx se trouve dans la partie antérieure du cou au niveau des vertèbres cervicales C3-C6. 

Il relie la partie inférieure du pharynx (hypopharynx) à la trachée. 

Le squelette laryngé est constitué de neuf cartilages : trois simples (épiglottique, thyroïdien et cricoïde) et trois appariés (aryténoïde, corniculé et cunéiforme). 

L'os hyoïde ne fait pas partie du larynx, bien que le larynx soit suspendu à l'os hyoïde. 

Le larynx s'étend verticalement de la pointe de l'épiglotte au bord inférieur du cartilage cricoïde. 

Son intérieur peut être divisé en supraglotte, glotte et sous-glotte.


=== Cartilages ===


Il y a neuf cartilages, trois non appariés et trois appariés (3 paires = 6), qui soutiennent le larynx des mammifères et forment son squelette.

Cartilages non appariés :

Le cartilage thyroïdien:
Cela forme la pomme d'Adam (également appelée proéminence laryngée).

Il est généralement plus grand chez les mâles que chez les femelles.

La membrane thyrohyoïdienne est un ligament associé au cartilage thyroïdien qui le relie à l'os hyoïde.

Il soutient la partie avant du larynx.

Cartilage cricoïde :
Anneau de cartilage hyalin qui forme la paroi inférieure du larynx.

Il est attaché au sommet de la trachée.

Le ligament cricothyroïdien médian relie le cartilage cricoïde au cartilage thyroïde.

Épiglotte :
Gros morceau de cartilage élastique en forme de cuillère.

Lors de la déglutition, le pharynx et le larynx se soulèvent.

L'élévation du pharynx l'élargit pour recevoir nourriture et boisson ; l'élévation du larynx fait descendre l'épiglotte et forme un couvercle sur la glotte, la fermant.

Cartilages appariés :

Cartilages aryténoïdes :
 Parmi les cartilages appariés, les cartilages aryténoïdes sont les plus importants car ils influencent la position et la tension des cordes vocales. 

Ce sont des morceaux triangulaires de cartilage principalement hyalin situés au bord postéro-supérieur du cartilage cricoïde.

Cartilages corniculés : 
 Morceaux de cartilage élastique en forme de corne situés au sommet de chaque cartilage aryténoïde.
 
Cartilages cunéiformes : 
 Morceaux de cartilage élastique en forme de massue situés en avant des cartilages corniculés.


=== Muscles ===

Les muscles du larynx sont divisés en muscles intrinsèques et extrinsèques. 

Les muscles extrinsèques agissent sur la région et passent entre le larynx et les parties qui l'entourent mais ont leur origine ailleurs ; les muscles intrinsèques sont entièrement confinés dans le larynx et y trouvent leur origine et leur insertion.

Les muscles intrinsèques sont divisés en muscles respiratoires et phonatoires (les muscles de la phonation).

Les muscles respiratoires écartent les cordes vocales et servent à la respiration.

Les muscles phonatoires rassemblent les cordes vocales et servent à la production de la voix.

Les principaux muscles respiratoires sont les muscles cricoaryténoïdes postérieurs.

Les muscles phonatoires sont divisés en adducteurs (muscles crico-aryténoïdes latéraux, muscles aryténoïdes) et en tenseurs (muscles crico-thyroïdiens, muscles thyro-aryténoïdes).


==== Intrinsèque ====
Les muscles intrinsèques du larynx sont responsables du contrôle de la production sonore.

Le muscle cricothyroïdien allonge et tend les cordes vocales.

Les muscles cricoaryténoïdes postérieurs enlèvent et font pivoter vers l'extérieur les cartilages aryténoïdes, ce qui entraîne l'abduction des cordes vocales.

Les muscles cricoaryténoïdes latéraux s'adduisent et font pivoter en interne les cartilages aryténoïdes, augmentent la compression médiale.

Le muscle aryténoïde transverse s'adduit aux cartilages aryténoïdes, ce qui entraîne l'adduction des cordes vocales.

Les muscles aryténoïdes obliques rétrécissent l'entrée laryngée en réduisant la distance entre les cartilages aryténoïdes.

Les muscles thyroaryténoïdes rétrécissent l'entrée du larynx, raccourcissent les cordes vocales et abaissent la hauteur de la voix. 

Le thyro-aryténoïde interne est la partie du thyro-aryténoïde qui vibre pour produire un son. Notamment, le seul muscle capable de séparer les cordes vocales pour une respiration normale est le crico-aryténoïde postérieur. 

Si ce muscle est frappé d'incapacité des deux côtés, l'incapacité de séparer les cordes vocales (enlèvement) entraînera des difficultés respiratoires.

Une lésion bilatérale du nerf laryngé récurrent serait à l'origine de cette affection.

Il convient également de noter que tous les muscles sont innervés par la branche laryngée récurrente du nerf vague, à l'exception du muscle cricothyroïdien, qui est innervé par la branche laryngée externe du nerf laryngé supérieur (une branche du nerf vague).

De plus, les muscles laryngés intrinsèques présentent un profil constitutif de tampon Ca2+ qui prédit leur meilleure capacité à gérer les changements de calcium par rapport aux autres muscles. 

Ce profil est en accord avec leur fonction de muscles très rapides avec une capacité de travail prolongée bien développée. 

Des études suggèrent que les mécanismes impliqués dans la séquestration rapide du Ca2+ (protéines de recapture du Ca2+ du réticulum sarcoplasmique, pompes à membrane plasmique et protéines cytosoliques tamponnant le Ca2+) sont particulièrement élevés dans les muscles laryngés, ce qui indique leur importance pour la fonction des myofibres et la protection contre les maladies, telles que que la dystrophie musculaire de Duchenne. 

De plus, différents niveaux d'Orai1 dans les muscles laryngés intrinsèques du rat et les muscles extraoculaires sur le muscle des membres suggèrent un rôle des canaux d'entrée du calcium exploités en magasin dans les propriétés fonctionnelles et les mécanismes de signalisation de ces muscles.


==== Extrinsèque ====

Les muscles laryngés extrinsèques soutiennent et positionnent le larynx dans la région mi-cervicale. [trachée.]

-Les muscles sternothyroïdiens dépriment le larynx. (Innervé par l'anse cervicale)
-Les muscles omohyoïdiens dépriment le larynx. (Anse cervicale)
-Les muscles sternohyoïdiens dépriment le larynx. (Anse cervicale)
- Muscles constricteurs inférieurs. (CN X)
-Les muscles thyrohyoïdiens élèvent le larynx. (C1)
-Le digastrique élève le larynx. (NC V3, CN VII)
-Stylohyoid élève le larynx. (CN VII)
-Mylohyoid élève le larynx. (CN V3)
- Le géniohyoïdien élève le larynx. (C1)
-Hyoglosse élève le larynx. (CN XII)
- Le génioglosse élève le larynx. (CN XII)


=== Innervation ===

Le larynx est innervé par des branches du nerf vague de chaque côté. 

L'innervation sensorielle de la glotte et du vestibule laryngé se fait par la branche interne du nerf laryngé supérieur. 

La branche externe du nerf laryngé supérieur innerve le muscle cricothyroïdien. 

L'innervation motrice de tous les autres muscles du larynx et l'innervation sensorielle de la sous-glotte se fait par le nerf laryngé récurrent. 

Alors que l'entrée sensorielle décrite ci-dessus est une sensation viscérale (générale) (diffuse, mal localisée), les cordes vocales reçoivent également une innervation sensorielle somatique générale (proprioceptive et tactile) par le nerf laryngé supérieur.

Une blessure au nerf laryngé externe provoque un affaiblissement de la phonation car les cordes vocales ne peuvent pas être resserrées.

Une blessure à l'un des nerfs laryngés récurrents produit un enrouement, si les deux sont endommagés, la voix peut ou non être préservée, mais la respiration devient difficile.


=== Développement ===

Chez les nouveau-nés, le larynx se situe initialement au niveau des vertèbres C2-C3, et est plus en avant et plus haut par rapport à sa position dans le corps adulte.

Le larynx descend à mesure que l'enfant grandit.


== Fonction ==

=== Génération sonore ===

Le son est généré dans le larynx, et c'est là que la hauteur et le volume sont manipulés.

La force de l'expiration des poumons contribue également au volume.

La manipulation du larynx est utilisée pour générer un son source avec une fréquence fondamentale particulière, ou hauteur. 

Ce son source est altéré lorsqu'il se déplace dans le tractus vocal, configuré différemment en fonction de la position de la langue, des lèvres, de la bouche et du pharynx. 

Le processus de modification d'un son source lorsqu'il passe à travers le filtre du tractus vocal crée les nombreux sons de voyelle et de consonne différents des langues du monde ainsi que le ton, certaines réalisations de stress et d'autres types de prosodie linguistique. 

Le larynx a également une fonction similaire aux poumons en créant des différences de pression nécessaires à la production sonore ; un larynx resserré peut être élevé ou abaissé, affectant le volume de la cavité buccale si nécessaire dans les consonnes glottaliques.

Les cordes vocales peuvent être maintenues rapprochées (par adduction des cartilages aryténoïdes) afin qu'elles vibrent (voir phonation). 

Les muscles attachés aux cartilages aryténoïdes contrôlent le degré d'ouverture. 

La longueur et la tension des cordes vocales peuvent être contrôlées en faisant basculer le cartilage thyroïde vers l'avant et vers l'arrière sur le cartilage cricoïde (soit directement en contractant les cricothyroïdes, soit indirectement en modifiant la position verticale du larynx), en manipulant la tension des muscles dans les cordes vocales , et en déplaçant les aryténoïdes vers l'avant ou vers l'arrière. 

Cela fait monter ou descendre la hauteur produite pendant la phonation. 

Chez la plupart des hommes, les cordes vocales sont plus longues et avec une masse plus importante que les cordes vocales de la plupart des femmes, produisant une tonalité plus basse.

L'appareil vocal est constitué de deux paires de plis, les plis vestibulaires (fausses cordes vocales) et les vraies cordes vocales.

Les plis vestibulaires sont recouverts d'épithélium respiratoire, tandis que les cordes vocales sont recouvertes d'épithélium pavimenteux stratifié.

Les plis vestibulaires ne sont pas responsables de la production sonore, mais plutôt de la résonance.

Les exceptions à cela se trouvent dans le chant tibétain et le Kargyraa, un style de chant de gorge tuvan.

Les deux utilisent les plis vestibulaires pour créer une nuance.

Ces fausses cordes vocales ne contiennent pas de muscle, tandis que les vraies cordes vocales ont du muscle squelettique.


=== Autre ===


Le rôle le plus important du larynx est sa fonction protectrice ; la prévention de la pénétration de corps étrangers dans les poumons par la toux et d'autres actions réflexes.

Une toux est initiée par une inspiration profonde à travers les cordes vocales, suivie de l'élévation du larynx et de l'adduction serrée (fermeture) des cordes vocales.

L'expiration forcée qui suit, assistée par le recul des tissus et les muscles de l'expiration, écarte les cordes vocales et la haute pression expulse l'objet irritant hors de la gorge.

Le raclement de gorge est moins violent que la toux, mais est un effort respiratoire accru similaire contré par le resserrement de la musculature laryngée.

La toux et le raclement de gorge sont des actions prévisibles et nécessaires car elles dégagent les voies respiratoires, mais les deux soumettent les cordes vocales à une tension importante.

Un autre rôle important du larynx est la fixation abdominale, une sorte de manœuvre de Valsalva dans laquelle les poumons sont remplis d'air afin de raidir le thorax afin que les forces appliquées pour le levage puissent être transmises aux jambes. 

Ceci est réalisé par une inspiration profonde suivie de l'adduction des cordes vocales. 

Le grognement en soulevant des objets lourds est le résultat de l'air qui s'échappe par les cordes vocales en adduction, prêt pour la phonation.

L'abduction des cordes vocales est importante lors d'un effort physique. 

Les cordes vocales sont séparées d'environ 8 mm (0,31 po) pendant la respiration normale, mais cette largeur est doublée pendant la respiration forcée.

Pendant la déglutition, l'élévation de la partie postérieure de la langue fait levier (inverse) l'épiglotte au-dessus de l'ouverture de la glotte pour empêcher le matériel avalé de pénétrer dans le larynx qui mène aux poumons, et fournit un chemin pour qu'un bol alimentaire ou liquide « glisse » dans l'œsophage; le complexe hyo-laryngé est également tiré vers le haut pour faciliter ce processus.

La stimulation du larynx par de la nourriture ou du liquide aspiré produit un fort réflexe de toux pour protéger les poumons.

De plus, les muscles laryngés intrinsèques sont épargnés par certains troubles de fonte musculaire, tels que la dystrophie musculaire de Duchenne, ce qui peut faciliter le développement de nouvelles stratégies pour la prévention et le traitement de la fonte musculaire dans une variété de scénarios cliniques.

Les ILM ont un profil de système de régulation du calcium suggérant une meilleure capacité à gérer les changements de calcium par rapport aux autres muscles, ce qui peut fournir un aperçu mécaniste de leurs propriétés physiopathologiques uniques.


== Signification clinique ==

=== Troubles ===


Il y a plusieurs choses qui peuvent empêcher un larynx de fonctionner correctement. 

Certains symptômes sont un enrouement, une perte de voix, des douleurs dans la gorge ou les oreilles et des difficultés respiratoires. 

La laryngite aiguë est une inflammation et un gonflement soudains du larynx. 

Elle est causée par le rhume ou par des cris excessifs. 

C'est pas grave. 

La laryngite chronique est causée par le tabagisme, la poussière, les cris fréquents ou une exposition prolongée à de l'air pollué. 

C'est beaucoup plus grave qu'une laryngite aiguë.

Le presbylarynx est une condition dans laquelle l'atrophie liée à l'âge des tissus mous du larynx entraîne une voix faible et une portée et une endurance vocales restreintes.

L'inclinaison de la partie antérieure des rhumes vocaux se retrouve à la laryngoscopie.

Les ulcères peuvent être causés par la présence prolongée d'une sonde endotrachéale.

Les polypes et les nodules des cordes vocales sont de petites bosses causées respectivement par une exposition prolongée à la fumée de tabac et à une mauvaise utilisation de la voix.

Deux types apparentés de cancer du larynx, à savoir le carcinome épidermoïde et le carcinome verruqueux, sont fortement associés à une exposition répétée à la fumée de cigarette et à l'alcool.

La parésie des cordes vocales est une faiblesse d'une ou des deux cordes vocales qui peut avoir un impact important sur la vie quotidienne.

Spasme laryngé idiopathique.

Le reflux laryngopharyngé est une condition dans laquelle l'acide de l'estomac irrite et brûle le larynx.

Des dommages similaires peuvent survenir avec le reflux gastro-œsophagien (RGO).
La laryngomalacie est une affection très courante de la petite enfance, dans laquelle le cartilage mou et immature du larynx supérieur s'effondre vers l'intérieur lors de l'inhalation, provoquant une obstruction des voies respiratoires.

Périchondrite laryngée, inflammation du périchondre des cartilages laryngés, provoquant une obstruction des voies respiratoires.

La paralysie laryngée est une affection observée chez certains mammifères (y compris les chiens) dans laquelle le larynx ne s'ouvre plus aussi largement que nécessaire pour le passage de l'air et entrave la respiration. 

Dans les cas bénins, cela peut entraîner une respiration ou un halètement exagéré ou "râpeux", et dans les cas graves, cela peut nécessiter un traitement considérable.

Dystrophie musculaire de Duchenne, les muscles laryngés intrinsèques (ILM) sont épargnés par le manque de dystrophine et peuvent servir de modèle utile pour étudier les mécanismes d'épargne musculaire dans les maladies neuromusculaires.

L'ILM dystrophique a présenté une augmentation significative de l'expression des protéines de liaison au calcium.

L'augmentation des protéines de liaison au calcium dans la MLI dystrophique peut permettre un meilleur maintien de l'homéostasie calcique, avec pour conséquence l'absence de myonécrose.

Les résultats étayent davantage le concept selon lequel un tampon calcique anormal est impliqué dans ces maladies neuromusculaires.


== Traitements ==

Les patients qui ont perdu l'usage de leur larynx se voient généralement prescrire l'utilisation d'un dispositif électrolarynx.

Les greffes de larynx sont une procédure rare.

La première opération réussie au monde a eu lieu en 1998 à la Cleveland Clinic, et la seconde a eu lieu en octobre 2010 au Davis Medical Center de l'Université de Californie à Sacramento.


== Autres animaux ==


Des travaux pionniers sur la structure et l'évolution du larynx ont été menés dans les années 1920 par l'anatomiste comparatif britannique Victor Negus, aboutissant à son ouvrage monumental The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929). 

Negus, cependant, a souligné que la descente du larynx reflétait le remodelage et la descente de la langue humaine dans le pharynx. 

Ce processus n'est pas complet avant l'âge de six à huit ans. 

Certains chercheurs, tels que Philip Lieberman, Dennis Klatt, Bart de Boer et Kenneth Stevens, utilisant des techniques de modélisation informatique, ont suggéré que la langue humaine spécifique à l'espèce permet au conduit vocal (les voies respiratoires au-dessus du larynx) de prendre les formes nécessaires pour produire la parole. des sons qui renforcent la robustesse de la parole humaine. 

Des sons tels que les voyelles des mots voir et faire, [i] et [u], (en notation phonétique) se sont avérés moins sujets à confusion dans des études classiques telles que l'enquête Peterson et Barney de 1950 sur les possibilités d'informatique. reconnaissance de la parole.

En revanche, bien que d'autres espèces aient des larynges bas, leurs langues restent ancrées dans leur bouche et leurs voies vocales ne peuvent pas produire la gamme de sons de la parole des humains. 

La capacité d'abaisser le larynx de manière transitoire chez certaines espèces étend la longueur de leur appareil vocal, ce qui, comme l'a montré Fitch, crée l'illusion acoustique qu'elles sont plus grandes. 

Des recherches menées aux laboratoires Haskins dans les années 1960 ont montré que la parole permet aux humains d'atteindre un taux de communication vocale qui dépasse la fréquence de fusion du système auditif en fusionnant les sons en syllabes et en mots. 

Les sons de parole supplémentaires que la langue humaine nous permet de produire, en particulier [i], permettent aux humains de déduire inconsciemment la longueur du conduit vocal de la personne qui parle, élément essentiel pour retrouver les phonèmes qui composent un mot.


=== Non-mammifères ===

La plupart des espèces de tétrapodes possèdent un larynx, mais sa structure est généralement plus simple que celle trouvée chez les mammifères. 

Les cartilages entourant le larynx sont apparemment un vestige des arcs branchiaux d'origine chez les poissons et sont une caractéristique commune, mais tous ne sont pas toujours présents.

Par exemple, le cartilage thyroïde ne se trouve que chez les mammifères.

De même, seuls les mammifères possèdent une véritable épiglotte, bien qu'un lambeau de muqueuse non cartilagineuse se retrouve dans une position similaire dans de nombreux autres groupes.

Chez les amphibiens modernes, le squelette laryngé est considérablement réduit ; les grenouilles n'ont que les cartilages cricoïdes et aryténoïdes, tandis que les salamandres ne possèdent que les aryténoïdes. Les cordes vocales ne se trouvent que chez les mammifères et quelques lézards.

En conséquence, de nombreux reptiles et amphibiens sont essentiellement sans voix ; les grenouilles utilisent des crêtes dans la trachée pour moduler le son, tandis que les oiseaux ont un organe distinct produisant le son, la syrinx.


== Historique ==

L'ancien médecin grec Galen a décrit pour la première fois le larynx, le décrivant comme "le premier et le plus important instrument de la voix".

LARINGE


A laringe (), comumente chamada de caixa vocal, é um órgão na parte superior do pescoço envolvido na respiração, produzindo som e protegendo a traqueia contra a aspiração de alimentos.

A abertura da laringe na faringe, conhecida como entrada laríngea, tem cerca de 4 a 5 centímetros de diâmetro.

A laringe abriga as cordas vocais e manipula o tom e o volume, o que é essencial para a fonação.

Situa-se logo abaixo de onde o trato da faringe se divide em traqueia e esôfago.

A palavra laringe (plural laringes) vem de uma palavra grega antiga semelhante (λάρυγξ lárynx).


== Estrutura ==


A laringe em forma de triângulo consiste em grande parte de cartilagens que estão ligadas umas às outras e às estruturas circundantes, por músculos ou por componentes de tecido fibroso e elástico.

A laringe é revestida por um epitélio colunar ciliado, exceto pelas pregas vocais.

A cavidade da laringe se estende de sua entrada em forma de triângulo até a epiglote e até a saída circular na borda inferior da cartilagem cricóide, onde é contínua com o lúmen da traqueia.

A membrana mucosa que reveste a laringe forma dois pares de pregas laterais que se projetam para dentro de sua cavidade. 

As pregas superiores são chamadas de pregas vestibulares. 

Eles também são chamados às vezes de cordas vocais falsas pela razão bastante óbvia de que não desempenham nenhum papel na vocalização. 

O par inferior de pregas é conhecido como cordas vocais, que produzem os sons necessários para a fala e outras vocalizações. 

O espaço em forma de fenda entre as cordas vocais esquerda e direita, chamado rima glottidis, é a parte mais estreita da laringe. 

As cordas vocais e a rima da glote são designadas juntas como glote. 

A cavidade laríngea acima das pregas vestibulares é chamada de vestíbulo. 

A porção média da cavidade entre as pregas vestibulares e as cordas vocais é o ventrículo da laringe, ou ventrículo laríngeo. 

A cavidade infraglótica é o espaço aberto abaixo da glote.


=== Localização ===

Em humanos adultos, a laringe é encontrada na região anterior do pescoço ao nível das vértebras cervicais C3-C6. 

Ele conecta a parte inferior da faringe (hipofaringe) com a traqueia. 

O esqueleto laríngeo é composto por nove cartilagens: três únicas (epiglótica, tireóide e cricóide) e três pareadas (aritenóide, corniculada e cuneiforme). 

O osso hióide não faz parte da laringe, embora a laringe esteja suspensa do hióide. 

A laringe estende-se verticalmente da ponta da epiglote até a borda inferior da cartilagem cricóide. 

Seu interior pode ser dividido em supraglote, glote e subglote.


=== Cartilagens ===


São nove cartilagens, três não pareadas e três pareadas (3 pares=6), que sustentam a laringe dos mamíferos e formam seu esqueleto.

Cartilagens não pareadas:

Cartilagem da tireoide:
Isso forma o pomo de Adão (também chamado de proeminência laríngea).

Geralmente é maior nos machos do que nas fêmeas.

A membrana tireo-hióidea é um ligamento associado à cartilagem tireóidea que a conecta com o osso hióide.

Ele suporta a porção frontal da laringe.

Cartilagem cricoide:
Anel de cartilagem hialina que forma a parede inferior da laringe.

Está ligado ao topo da traqueia.

O ligamento cricotireóideo mediano conecta a cartilagem cricóide à cartilagem tireóidea.

Epiglote:
Um grande pedaço de cartilagem elástica em forma de colher.

Durante a deglutição, a faringe e a laringe se elevam.

A elevação da faringe a alarga para receber comida e bebida; A elevação da laringe faz com que a epiglote desça e forme uma tampa sobre a glote, fechando-a.

Cartilagens pareadas:

Cartilagens aritenoides:
Das cartilagens pareadas, as cartilagens aritenoides são as mais importantes, pois influenciam a posição e a tensão das cordas vocais.

São peças triangulares de cartilagem principalmente hialina localizadas na borda póstero-superior da cartilagem cricóide.

Cartilagens corniculadas:
Pedaços de cartilagem elástica em forma de chifre localizados no ápice de cada cartilagem aritenóide.
 
Cartilagens cuneiformes:
Pedaços de cartilagem elástica em forma de taco localizadas anteriormente às cartilagens corniculadas.


=== Músculos ===

Os músculos da laringe são divididos em músculos intrínsecos e extrínsecos.

Os músculos extrínsecos atuam na região e passam entre a laringe e partes ao seu redor, mas têm sua origem em outro lugar; os músculos intrínsecos estão inteiramente confinados na laringe e têm sua origem e inserção ali.

Os músculos intrínsecos são divididos em músculos respiratórios e fonatórios (os músculos da fonação). 

Os músculos respiratórios afastam as cordas vocais e servem à respiração. 

Os músculos fonatórios movem as cordas vocais juntas e servem para a produção da voz. 

Os principais músculos respiratórios são os músculos cricoaritenóideos posteriores. 

Os músculos fonatórios são divididos em adutores (músculos cricoaritenóideos laterais, músculos aritenóides) e tensores (músculos cricotireóideos, músculos tireoaritenóides).


==== Intrínseco ====
Os músculos intrínsecos da laringe são responsáveis ​​pelo controle da produção do som.

O músculo cricotireóideo alonga e tensiona as cordas vocais.

Os músculos cricoaritenóideos posteriores abduzem e giram externamente as cartilagens aritenóides, resultando em cordas vocais abduzidas.

Os músculos cricoaritenóideos laterais aduzem e rodam internamente as cartilagens aritenóides, aumentando a compressão medial.

O músculo aritenóideo transverso aduz as cartilagens aritenóides, resultando em cordas vocais aduzidas.

Os músculos aritenoides oblíquos estreitam a entrada laríngea ao reduzir a distância entre as cartilagens aritenoides.

Os músculos tireoaritenóideos estreitam a entrada laríngea, encurtando as cordas vocais e diminuindo o tom da voz.

O tireoaritenóideo interno é a porção do tireoaritenóideo que vibra para produzir som. Notavelmente, o único músculo capaz de separar as cordas vocais para a respiração normal é o cricoaritenóideo posterior.

Se este músculo estiver incapacitado em ambos os lados, a incapacidade de separar as cordas vocais (abduzir) causará dificuldade para respirar.

A lesão bilateral do nervo laríngeo recorrente causaria essa condição.

É importante notar também que todos os músculos são inervados pelo ramo laríngeo recorrente do vago, exceto o músculo cricotireóideo, que é inervado pelo ramo laríngeo externo do nervo laríngeo superior (um ramo do vago).

Além disso, os músculos intrínsecos da laringe apresentam um perfil constitutivo de tamponamento de Ca2+ que prediz sua melhor capacidade de lidar com as alterações de cálcio em comparação com outros músculos.

Este perfil está de acordo com sua função como músculos muito rápidos com uma capacidade bem desenvolvida para o trabalho prolongado.

Estudos sugerem que os mecanismos envolvidos no sequestro imediato de Ca2+ (proteínas de recaptação de Ca2+ do retículo sarcoplasmático, bombas de membrana plasmática e proteínas tamponantes de Ca2+ citosólicos) são particularmente elevados nos músculos laríngeos, indicando sua importância para a função das miofibras e proteção contra doenças, como como distrofia muscular de Duchenne.

Além disso, diferentes níveis de Orai1 em músculos intrínsecos da laringe e músculos extraoculares de ratos sobre o músculo do membro sugerem um papel para os canais de entrada de cálcio operados por armazenamento nas propriedades funcionais desses músculos e nos mecanismos de sinalização.


==== Extrínseco ====

Os músculos extrínsecos da laringe sustentam e posicionam a laringe na região médio-cervical. [traquéia.]

-Os músculos esternotireóideos deprimem a laringe. (Inervado pela alça cervical)
-Os músculos omo-hióideos deprimem a laringe. (Ansa cervicalis)
-Os músculos esterno-hióideos deprimem a laringe. (Ansa cervicalis)
-Músculos constritores inferiores. (CNX)
- Os músculos tireo-hióideos elevam a laringe. (C1)
-Digástrico eleva a laringe. (CN V3, CN VII)
-Estilo-hióideo eleva a laringe. (NC VII)
- O milo-hióideo eleva a laringe. (CN V3)
-Genio-hioideo eleva a laringe. (C1)
-Hioglosso eleva a laringe. (CN XII)
-Genioglossus eleva a laringe. (CN XII)


=== Suprimento nervoso ===

A laringe é inervada por ramos do nervo vago de cada lado.

A inervação sensitiva da glote e do vestíbulo laríngeo é feita pelo ramo interno do nervo laríngeo superior.

O ramo externo do nervo laríngeo superior inerva o músculo cricotireóideo.

A inervação motora de todos os outros músculos da laringe e a inervação sensitiva da subglote são feitas pelo nervo laríngeo recorrente.

Enquanto a entrada sensorial descrita acima é sensação visceral (geral) (difusa, mal localizada), as cordas vocais também recebem inervação sensorial somática geral (proprioceptiva e tátil) pelo nervo laríngeo superior.

A lesão do nervo laríngeo externo causa enfraquecimento da fonação porque as cordas vocais não podem ser apertadas.

A lesão de um dos nervos laríngeos recorrentes produz rouquidão, se ambos estiverem danificados a voz pode ou não ser preservada, mas a respiração torna-se difícil.


=== Desenvolvimento ===

Em recém-nascidos, a laringe está inicialmente no nível das vértebras C2-C3 e está mais para frente e mais alta em relação à sua posição no corpo adulto.

A laringe desce à medida que a criança cresce.


== Função ==

=== Geração de som ===

O som é gerado na laringe, e é aí que o tom e o volume são manipulados.

A força da expiração dos pulmões também contribui para o volume.

A manipulação da laringe é usada para gerar um som de origem com uma frequência fundamental específica, ou tom.

Esse som de origem é alterado à medida que percorre o trato vocal, configurado de forma diferente com base na posição da língua, lábios, boca e faringe.

O processo de alteração de um som de origem à medida que passa pelo filtro do trato vocal cria os muitos sons de vogais e consoantes das línguas do mundo, bem como o tom, certas realizações de estresse e outros tipos de prosódia linguística.

A laringe também tem uma função semelhante à dos pulmões na criação das diferenças de pressão necessárias para a produção do som; uma laringe constrita pode ser elevada ou abaixada afetando o volume da cavidade oral conforme necessário em consoantes glotálicas.

As cordas vocais podem ser mantidas juntas (por meio da adução das cartilagens aritenóides) para que elas vibrem (ver fonação). 

Os músculos ligados às cartilagens aritenoides controlam o grau de abertura. 

O comprimento e a tensão das cordas vocais podem ser controlados balançando a cartilagem tireóide para frente e para trás na cartilagem cricóide (diretamente pela contração dos cricotireóides ou indiretamente pela mudança da posição vertical da laringe), manipulando a tensão dos músculos dentro das cordas vocais , e movendo as aritenóides para frente ou para trás. 

Isso faz com que o tom produzido durante a fonação aumente ou diminua. 

Na maioria dos homens, as cordas vocais são mais longas e com maior massa do que as cordas vocais da maioria das mulheres, produzindo um tom mais baixo.

O aparelho vocal consiste em dois pares de pregas, as pregas vestibulares (pregas vocais falsas) e as pregas vocais verdadeiras. 

As pregas vestibulares são revestidas por epitélio respiratório, enquanto as pregas vocais são revestidas por epitélio escamoso estratificado. 

As pregas vestibulares não são responsáveis ​​pela produção do som, mas sim pela ressonância. 

As exceções a isso são encontradas no canto tibetano e Kargyraa, um estilo de canto de garganta tuvano. 

Ambos fazem uso das pregas vestibulares para criar um subtom. 

Essas cordas vocais falsas não contêm músculo, enquanto as cordas vocais verdadeiras têm músculo esquelético.


=== Outro ===


O papel mais importante da laringe é sua função protetora; a prevenção de objetos estranhos de entrar nos pulmões pela tosse e outras ações reflexivas.

A tosse é iniciada por uma inspiração profunda através das cordas vocais, seguida pela elevação da laringe e adução firme (fechamento) das cordas vocais.

A expiração forçada que se segue, auxiliada pela retração do tecido e pelos músculos da expiração, rompe as cordas vocais e a alta pressão expele o objeto irritante para fora da garganta.

A limpeza da garganta é menos violenta do que a tosse, mas é um esforço respiratório semelhante, contrabalançado pelo aperto da musculatura laríngea.

Tanto a tosse quanto a limpeza da garganta são ações previsíveis e necessárias porque limpam as vias respiratórias, mas ambas colocam as cordas vocais sob tensão significativa.

Outro papel importante da laringe é a fixação abdominal, uma espécie de manobra de Valsalva em que os pulmões são preenchidos com ar para enrijecer o tórax para que as forças aplicadas para o levantamento possam ser traduzidas para as pernas.

Isto é conseguido por uma inspiração profunda seguida pela adução das cordas vocais.

O grunhido ao levantar objetos pesados ​​é o resultado de algum ar escapando pelas cordas vocais aduzidas, prontas para a fonação.

A abdução das cordas vocais é importante durante o esforço físico.

As cordas vocais são separadas por cerca de 8 mm (0,31 pol) durante a respiração normal, mas essa largura é dobrada durante a respiração forçada.

Durante a deglutição, a elevação da porção posterior da língua alavanca (inverte) a epiglote sobre a abertura da glote para evitar que o material deglutido entre na laringe que leva aos pulmões e fornece um caminho para um bolo alimentar ou líquido "deslizar" no esôfago; o complexo hio-laríngeo também é puxado para cima para ajudar nesse processo.

A estimulação da laringe por alimentos ou líquidos aspirados produz um forte reflexo de tosse para proteger os pulmões.

Além disso, os músculos intrínsecos da laringe são poupados de alguns distúrbios do desgaste muscular, como a distrofia muscular de Duchenne, podendo facilitar o desenvolvimento de novas estratégias para a prevenção e tratamento do desgaste muscular em uma variedade de cenários clínicos.

ILM tem um perfil de sistema de regulação de cálcio sugestivo de uma melhor capacidade de lidar com alterações de cálcio em comparação com outros músculos, e isso pode fornecer uma visão mecanicista de suas propriedades fisiopatológicas únicas


== Significado clínico ==

=== Distúrbios ===


Existem várias coisas que podem fazer com que a laringe não funcione corretamente. 

Alguns sintomas são rouquidão, perda da voz, dor na garganta ou nos ouvidos e dificuldades respiratórias. 

A laringite aguda é a inflamação súbita e inchaço da laringe. 

É causada pelo resfriado comum ou por gritos excessivos. 

Não é sério. 

A laringite crônica é causada pelo fumo, poeira, gritos frequentes ou exposição prolongada ao ar poluído. 

É muito mais grave do que a laringite aguda.

A presbilaringe é uma condição na qual a atrofia relacionada à idade dos tecidos moles da laringe resulta em voz fraca e alcance e resistência vocal restritos.

O arqueamento da porção anterior dos resfriados vocais é encontrado na laringoscopia.

As úlceras podem ser causadas pela presença prolongada de um tubo endotraqueal.

Pólipos e nódulos nas cordas vocais são pequenos inchaços causados ​​pela exposição prolongada à fumaça do tabaco e mau uso vocal, respectivamente.

Dois tipos relacionados de câncer de laringe, o carcinoma de células escamosas e o carcinoma verrucoso, estão fortemente associados à exposição repetida à fumaça do cigarro e ao álcool.

A paresia das cordas vocais é a fraqueza de uma ou ambas as cordas vocais que pode afetar muito a vida diária.

Espasmo laríngeo idiopático.

O refluxo laringofaríngeo é uma condição na qual o ácido do estômago irrita e queima a laringe.

Danos semelhantes podem ocorrer com a doença do refluxo gastroesofágico (DRGE).
A laringomalácia é uma condição muito comum da infância, na qual a cartilagem macia e imatura da laringe superior colapsa para dentro durante a inspiração, causando obstrução das vias aéreas.

Pericondrite laríngea, a inflamação do pericôndrio das cartilagens laríngeas, causando obstrução das vias aéreas.

A paralisia laríngea é uma condição observada em alguns mamíferos (incluindo cães) em que a laringe não se abre tanto quanto o necessário para a passagem do ar e impede a respiração. 

Em casos leves, pode levar a respiração ou respiração exagerada ou "rouca" e, em casos graves, pode representar uma necessidade considerável de tratamento.

Distrofia muscular de Duchenne, os músculos intrínsecos da laringe (MIL) são poupados da falta de distrofina e podem servir como um modelo útil para estudar os mecanismos de preservação muscular nas doenças neuromusculares. 

A LMI distrófica apresentou aumento significativo na expressão de proteínas ligadoras de cálcio. 

O aumento das proteínas ligadoras de cálcio na MLI distrófica pode permitir uma melhor manutenção da homeostase do cálcio, com a conseqüente ausência de mionecrose. 

Os resultados apoiam ainda mais o conceito de que o tamponamento anormal de cálcio está envolvido nessas doenças neuromusculares.


== Tratamentos ==

Pacientes que perderam o uso de sua laringe geralmente são prescritos para o uso de um dispositivo eletrolaringe. 

Os transplantes de laringe são um procedimento raro. 

A primeira operação bem-sucedida do mundo ocorreu em 1998 na Cleveland Clinic, e a segunda ocorreu em outubro de 2010 no Centro Médico Davis da Universidade da Califórnia em Sacramento.


== Outros animais ==


O trabalho pioneiro sobre a estrutura e evolução da laringe foi realizado na década de 1920 pelo anatomista comparativo britânico Victor Negus, culminando em sua obra monumental O Mecanismo da Laringe (1929).

Negus, no entanto, apontou que a descida da laringe refletia a remodelação e descida da língua humana na faringe.

Este processo não está completo até a idade de seis a oito anos.

Alguns pesquisadores, como Philip Lieberman, Dennis Klatt, Bart de Boer e Kenneth Stevens, usando técnicas de modelagem computacional, sugeriram que a língua humana específica da espécie permite que o trato vocal (a via aérea acima da laringe) assuma as formas necessárias para produzir a fala. sons que aumentam a robustez da fala humana.

Sons como as vogais das palavras ver e fazer, [i] e [u], (em notação fonética) têm se mostrado menos sujeitos a confusão em estudos clássicos como a investigação de 1950 de Peterson e Barney sobre as possibilidades de reconhecimento de fala.

Em contraste, embora outras espécies tenham laringes baixas, suas línguas permanecem ancoradas em suas bocas e seus tratos vocais não podem produzir a variedade de sons da fala dos humanos.

A capacidade de abaixar a laringe transitoriamente em algumas espécies estende o comprimento de seu trato vocal, o que, como Fitch mostrou, cria a ilusão acústica de que eles são maiores.

Pesquisas nos Laboratórios Haskins na década de 1960 mostraram que a fala permite que os humanos alcancem uma taxa de comunicação vocal que excede a frequência de fusão do sistema auditivo, fundindo sons em sílabas e palavras.

Os sons de fala adicionais que a língua humana nos permite produzir, particularmente [i], permitem aos humanos inferir inconscientemente o comprimento do trato vocal da pessoa que está falando, um elemento crítico na recuperação dos fonemas que compõem uma palavra.


=== Não-mamíferos ===

A maioria das espécies de tetrápodes possui laringe, mas sua estrutura é tipicamente mais simples do que a encontrada em mamíferos.

As cartilagens que circundam a laringe são aparentemente remanescentes dos arcos branquiais originais dos peixes e são uma característica comum, mas nem sempre estão presentes. 

Por exemplo, a cartilagem tireóide é encontrada apenas em mamíferos. 

Da mesma forma, apenas os mamíferos possuem uma epiglote verdadeira, embora um retalho de mucosa não cartilaginosa seja encontrado em posição semelhante em muitos outros grupos. 

Nos anfíbios modernos, o esqueleto laríngeo é consideravelmente reduzido; as rãs têm apenas as cartilagens cricóide e aritenóide, enquanto as salamandras possuem apenas as aritenóides. As pregas vocais são encontradas apenas em mamíferos e em alguns lagartos.

Como resultado, muitos répteis e anfíbios são essencialmente sem voz; as rãs usam sulcos na traqueia para modular o som, enquanto os pássaros têm um órgão produtor de som separado, a siringe.


== História ==

O antigo médico grego Galeno descreveu pela primeira vez a laringe, descrevendo-a como o "primeiro e supremamente mais importante instrumento da voz".
