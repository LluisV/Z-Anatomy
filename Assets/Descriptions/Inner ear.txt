INNER EAR


The inner ear (internal ear, auris interna) is the innermost part of the vertebrate ear. 

In vertebrates, the inner ear is mainly responsible for sound detection and balance. 

In mammals, it consists of the bony labyrinth, a hollow cavity in the temporal bone of the skull with a system of passages comprising two main functional parts:
The cochlea, dedicated to hearing; converting sound pressure patterns from the outer ear into electrochemical impulses which are passed on to the brain via the auditory nerve.
The vestibular system, dedicated to balanceThe inner ear is found in all vertebrates, with substantial variations in form and function. 

The inner ear is innervated by the eighth cranial nerve in all vertebrates.


== Structure ==


The labyrinth can be divided by layer or by region.


=== Bony and membranous labyrinths ===

The bony labyrinth, or osseous labyrinth, is the network of passages with bony walls lined with periosteum. 

The three major parts of the bony labyrinth are the vestibule of the ear, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea. 

The membranous labyrinth runs inside of the bony labyrinth, and creates three parallel fluid filled spaces. 

The two outer are filled with perilymph and the inner with endolymph.


=== Vestibular and cochlear systems ===

In the middle ear, the energy of pressure waves is translated into mechanical vibrations by the three auditory ossicles. 

Pressure waves move the tympanic membrane which in turns moves the malleus, the first bone of the middle ear. 

The malleus articulates to incus which connects to the stapes. 

The footplate of the stapes connects to the oval window, the beginning of the inner ear. 

When the stapes presses on the oval window, it causes the perilymph, the liquid of the inner ear to move. 

The middle ear thus serves to convert the energy from sound pressure waves to a force upon the perilymph of the inner ear. 

The oval window has only approximately 1/18 the area of the tympanic membrane and thus produces a higher pressure. 

The cochlea propagates these mechanical signals as waves in the fluid and membranes and then converts them to nerve impulses which are transmitted to the brain.The vestibular system is the region of the inner ear where the semicircular canals converge, close to the cochlea. 

The vestibular system works with the visual system to keep objects in view when the head is moved. 

Joint and muscle receptors are also important in maintaining balance. 

The brain receives, interprets, and processes the information from all these systems to create the sensation of balance.
The vestibular system of the inner ear is responsible for the sensations of balance and motion. 

It uses the same kinds of fluids and detection cells (hair cells) as the cochlea uses, and sends information to the brain about the attitude, rotation, and linear motion of the head. 

The type of motion or attitude detected by a hair cell depends on its associated mechanical structures, such as the curved tube of a semicircular canal or the calcium carbonate crystals (otolith) of the saccule and utricle.


=== Development ===

The human inner ear develops during week 4 of embryonic development from the auditory placode, a thickening of the ectoderm which gives rise to the bipolar neurons of the cochlear and vestibular ganglions. 

As the auditory placode invaginates towards the embryonic mesoderm, it forms the auditory vesicle or otocyst.
The auditory vesicle will give rise to the utricular and saccular components of the membranous labyrinth. 

They contain the sensory hair cells and otoliths of the macula of utricle and of the saccule, respectively, which respond to linear acceleration and the force of gravity. 

The utricular division of the auditory vesicle also responds to angular acceleration, as well as the endolymphatic sac and duct that connect the saccule and utricle.
Beginning in the fifth week of development, the auditory vesicle also gives rise to the cochlear duct, which contains the spiral organ of Corti and the endolymph that accumulates in the membranous labyrinth. 

The vestibular wall will separate the cochlear duct from the perilymphatic scala vestibuli, a cavity inside the cochlea. 

The basilar membrane separates the cochlear duct from the scala tympani, a cavity within the cochlear labyrinth. 

The lateral wall of the cochlear duct is formed by the spiral ligament and the stria vascularis, which produces the endolymph. 

The hair cells develop from the lateral and medial ridges of the cochlear duct, which together with the tectorial membrane make up the organ of Corti.


=== Microanatomy ===


Rosenthal's canal or the spiral canal of the cochlea is a section of the bony labyrinth of the inner ear that is approximately 30 mm long and makes 2¾ turns about the modiolus, the central axis of the cochlea that contains the spiral ganglion.
Specialized inner ear cell include: hair cells, pillar cells, Boettcher's cells, Claudius' cells, spiral ganglion neurons, and Deiters' cells (phalangeal cells).
The hair cells are the primary auditory receptor cells and they are also known as auditory sensory cells, acoustic hair cells, auditory cells or cells of Corti. 

The organ of Corti is lined with a single row of inner hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells. 

The hair cells have a hair bundle at the apical surface of the cell. 

The hair bundle consists of an array of actin-based stereocilia. 

Each stereocilium inserts as a rootlet into a dense filamentous actin mesh known as the cuticular plate. 

Disruption of these bundles results in hearing impairments and balance defects.
Inner and outer pillar cells in the organ of Corti support hair cells. 

Outer pillar cells are unique because they are free standing cells which only contact adjacent cells at the bases and apices. 

Both types of pillar cell have thousands of cross linked microtubules and actin filaments in parallel orientation. 

They provide mechanical coupling between the basement membrane and the mechanoreceptors on the hair cells.
Boettcher's cells are found in the organ of Corti where they are present only in the lower turn of the cochlea. 

They lie on the basilar membrane beneath Claudius' cells and are organized in rows, the number of which varies between species. 

The cells interdigitate with each other, and project microvilli into the intercellular space. 

They are supporting cells for the auditory hair cells in the organ of Corti. 

They are named after German pathologist Arthur Böttcher (1831-1889).
Claudius' cells are found in the organ of Corti located above rows of Boettcher's cells. 

Like Boettcher's cells, they are considered supporting cells for the auditory hair cells in the organ of Corti. 

They contain a variety of aquaporin water channels and appear to be involved in ion transport. 

They also play a role in sealing off endolymphatic spaces. 

They are named after the German anatomist Friedrich Matthias Claudius (1822-1869).
Deiters' cells (phalangeal cells) are a type of neuroglial cell found in the organ of Corti and organised in one row of inner phalangeal cells and three rows of outer phalangeal cells. 

They are the supporting cells of the hair cell area within the cochlea. 

They are named after the German pathologist Otto Deiters (1834-1863) who described them.
Hensen's cells are high columnar cells that are directly adjacent to the third row of Deiters’ cells.
Hensen's stripe is the section of the tectorial membrane above the inner hair cell.
Nuel's spaces refer to the fluid-filled spaces between the outer pillar cells and adjacent hair cells and also the spaces between the outer hair cells.
Hardesty's membrane is the layer of the tectoria closest to the reticular lamina and overlying the outer hair cell region.
Reissner's membrane is composed of two cell layers and separates the scala media from the scala vestibuli.
Huschke's teeth are the tooth-shaped ridges on the spiral limbus that are in contact with the tectoria and separated by interdental cells.


=== Blood supply ===

The bony labyrinth receives its blood supply from three arteries:
1- Anterior tympanic branch (from maxillary artery).
2- Petrosal branch (from middle meningeal artery).
3- Stylomastoid branch (from posterior auricular artery).
The membranous labyrinth is supplied by the labyrinthine artery.
Venous drainage of the inner ear is through the labyrinthine vein, which empties into the sigmoid sinus or inferior petrosal sinus.


== Function ==

Neurons within the ear respond to simple tones, and the brain serves to process other increasingly complex sounds. 

An average adult is typically able to detect sounds ranging between 20 and 20,000 Hz. 

The ability to detect higher pitch sounds decreases in older humans.
The human ear has evolved with two basic tools to encode sound waves; each is separate in detecting high and low-frequency sounds. 

Georg von Békésy (1899-1972) employed the use of a microscope in order to examine the basilar membrane located within the inner-ear of cadavers. 

He found that movement of the basilar membrane resembles that of a traveling wave; the shape of which varies based on the frequency of the pitch. 

In low-frequency sounds, the tip (apex) of the membrane moves the most, while in high-frequency sounds, the base of the membrane moves most.


== Disorders ==


Interference with or infection of the labyrinth can result in a syndrome of ailments called labyrinthitis. 

The symptoms of labyrinthitis include temporary nausea, disorientation, vertigo, and dizziness. 

Labyrinthitis can be caused by viral infections, bacterial infections, or physical blockage of the inner ear.Another condition has come to be known as autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). 

It is characterized by idiopathic, rapidly progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. 

It is a fairly rare disorder while at the same time, a lack of proper diagnostic testing has meant that its precise incidence cannot be determined.


== Other animals ==

Birds have an auditory system similar to that of mammals, including a cochlea. 

Reptiles, amphibians, and fish do not have cochleas but hear with simpler auditory organs or vestibular organs, which generally detect lower-frequency sounds than the cochlea. 

The cochlea of birds is similar to that of crocodiles, consisting of a short, slightly curved bony tube within which lies the basilar membrane with its sensory structures.


=== Cochlear system ===


In reptiles, sound is transmitted to the inner ear by the stapes (stirrup) bone of the middle ear. 

This is pressed against the oval window, a membrane-covered opening on the surface of the vestibule. 

From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, the round window, which equalizes pressure, allowing the incompressible fluid to move freely. 

Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph. 

The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a basilar membrane, and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals. 

It is attached at one end to the saccule.In most reptiles the perilymphatic duct and lagena are relatively short, and the sensory cells are confined to a small basilar papilla lying between them. 

However, in mammals, birds, and crocodilians, these structures become much larger and somewhat more complicated. 

In birds, crocodilians, and monotremes, the ducts are simply extended, together forming an elongated, more or less straight, tube. 

The endolymphatic duct is wrapped in a simple loop around the lagena, with the basilar membrane lying along one side. 

The first half of the duct is now referred to as the scala vestibuli, while the second half, which includes the basilar membrane, is called the scala tympani. 

As a result of this increase in length, the basilar membrane and papilla are both extended, with the latter developing into the organ of Corti, while the lagena is now called the cochlear duct. 

All of these structures together constitute the cochlea.In mammals (other than monotremes), the cochlea is extended still further, becoming a coiled structure in order to accommodate its length within the head. 

The organ of Corti also has a more complex structure in mammals than it does in other amniotes.The arrangement of the inner ear in living amphibians is, in most respects, similar to that of reptiles. 

However, they often lack a basilar papilla, having instead an entirely separate set of sensory cells at the upper edge of the saccule, referred to as the papilla amphibiorum, which appear to have the same function.Although many fish are capable of hearing, the lagena is, at best, a short diverticulum of the saccule, and appears to have no role in sensation of sound. 

Various clusters of hair cells within the inner ear may instead be responsible; for example, bony fish contain a sensory cluster called the macula neglecta in the utricle that may have this function. 

Although fish have neither an outer nor a middle ear, sound may still be transmitted to the inner ear through the bones of the skull, or by the swim bladder, parts of which often lie close by in the body.


=== Vestibular system ===

By comparison with the cochlear system, the vestibular system varies relatively little between the various groups of jawed vertebrates. 

The central part of the system consists of two chambers, the saccule and utricle, each of which includes one or two small clusters of sensory hair cells. 

All jawed vertebrates also possess three semicircular canals arising from the utricle, each with an ampulla containing sensory cells at one end.An endolymphatic duct runs from the saccule up through the head and ending close to the brain. 

In cartilaginous fish, this duct actually opens onto the top of the head, and in some teleosts, it is simply blind-ending. 

In all other species, however, it ends in an endolymphatic sac. 

In many reptiles, fish, and amphibians this sac may reach considerable size. 

In amphibians the sacs from either side may fuse into a single structure, which often extends down the length of the body, parallel with the spinal canal.The primitive lampreys and hagfish, however, have a simpler system. 

The inner ear in these species consists of a single vestibular chamber, although in lampreys, this is associated with a series of sacs lined by cilia. 

Lampreys have only two semicircular canals, with the horizontal canal being absent, while hagfish have only a single, vertical, canal.


=== Equilibrium ===

The inner ear is primarily responsible for balance, equilibrium and orientation in three-dimensional space. 

The inner ear can detect both static and dynamic equilibrium. 

Three semicircular ducts and two chambers, which contain the saccule and utricle, enable the body to detect any deviation from equilibrium. 

The macula sacculi detects vertical acceleration while the macula utriculi is responsible for horizontal acceleration. 

These microscopic structures possess stereocilia and one kinocilium which are located within the gelatinous otolithic membrane. 

The membrane is further weighted with otoliths. 

Movement of the stereocilia and kinocilium enable the hair cells of the saccula and utricle to detect motion. 

The semicircular ducts are responsible for detecting rotational movement.

OÍDO INTERNO


El oído interno (oído interno, auris interna) es la parte más interna del oído de los vertebrados.

En los vertebrados, el oído interno es el principal responsable de la detección y el equilibrio del sonido.

En los mamíferos, consiste en el laberinto óseo, una cavidad hueca en el hueso temporal del cráneo con un sistema de pasajes que comprende dos partes funcionales principales:
La cóclea, dedicada a la audición; convertir patrones de presión de sonido del oído externo en impulsos electroquímicos que se transmiten al cerebro a través del nervio auditivo.
El sistema vestibular, dedicado al equilibrio El oído interno se encuentra en todos los vertebrados, con variaciones sustanciales en forma y función. 

El oído interno está inervado por el octavo nervio craneal en todos los vertebrados.


== Estructura ==


El laberinto se puede dividir por capa o por región.


=== Laberintos óseos y membranosos ===

El laberinto óseo, o laberinto óseo, es la red de pasajes con paredes óseas revestidas de periostio. 

Las tres partes principales del laberinto óseo son el vestíbulo del oído, los canales semicirculares y la cóclea. 

El laberinto membranoso corre dentro del laberinto óseo y crea tres espacios paralelos llenos de líquido. 

Los dos exteriores están llenos de perilinfa y el interior de endolinfa.


=== Sistemas vestibular y coclear ===

En el oído medio, la energía de las ondas de presión se traduce en vibraciones mecánicas por los tres osículos auditivos.

Las ondas de presión mueven la membrana timpánica que a su vez mueve el martillo, el primer hueso del oído medio.

El martillo se articula con el yunque que se conecta al estribo.

La base del estribo se conecta a la ventana oval, el comienzo del oído interno.

Cuando el estribo presiona la ventana oval, hace que la perilinfa, el líquido del oído interno, se mueva.

El oído medio sirve así para convertir la energía de las ondas de presión del sonido en una fuerza sobre la perilinfa del oído interno.

La ventana oval tiene solo aproximadamente 1/18 del área de la membrana timpánica y, por lo tanto, produce una presión más alta.

La cóclea propaga estas señales mecánicas como ondas en el líquido y las membranas y luego las convierte en impulsos nerviosos que se transmiten al cerebro. El sistema vestibular es la región del oído interno donde convergen los canales semicirculares, cerca de la cóclea.

El sistema vestibular trabaja con el sistema visual para mantener los objetos a la vista cuando se mueve la cabeza.

Los receptores articulares y musculares también son importantes para mantener el equilibrio.

El cerebro recibe, interpreta y procesa la información de todos estos sistemas para crear la sensación de equilibrio.
El sistema vestibular del oído interno es responsable de las sensaciones de equilibrio y movimiento.

Utiliza los mismos tipos de fluidos y células de detección (células ciliadas) que utiliza la cóclea y envía información al cerebro sobre la actitud, la rotación y el movimiento lineal de la cabeza.

El tipo de movimiento o actitud que detecta una célula ciliada depende de sus estructuras mecánicas asociadas, como el tubo curvo de un canal semicircular o los cristales de carbonato de calcio (otolito) del sáculo y el utrículo.


=== Desarrollo ===

El oído interno humano se desarrolla durante la semana 4 del desarrollo embrionario a partir de la placoda auditiva, un engrosamiento del ectodermo que da origen a las neuronas bipolares de los ganglios coclear y vestibular. 

A medida que la placoda auditiva se invagina hacia el mesodermo embrionario, forma la vesícula auditiva u otoquiste.
La vesícula auditiva dará lugar a los componentes utricular y sacular del laberinto membranoso. 

Contienen las células ciliadas sensoriales y los otolitos de la mácula del utrículo y del sáculo, respectivamente, que responden a la aceleración lineal ya la fuerza de la gravedad. 

La división utricular de la vesícula auditiva también responde a la aceleración angular, así como el saco y conducto endolinfático que conecta el sáculo y el utrículo.
A partir de la quinta semana de desarrollo, la vesícula auditiva también da origen al conducto coclear, que contiene el órgano espiral de Corti y la endolinfa que se acumula en el laberinto membranoso.

La pared vestibular separará el conducto coclear de la rampa vestibular perilinfática, una cavidad dentro de la cóclea.

La membrana basilar separa el conducto coclear de la rampa timpánica, una cavidad dentro del laberinto coclear.

La pared lateral del conducto coclear está formada por el ligamento espiral y la estría vascular, que produce la endolinfa.

Las células ciliadas se desarrollan a partir de las crestas lateral y medial del conducto coclear, que junto con la membrana tectoria forman el órgano de Corti.


=== Microanatomía ===


El canal de Rosenthal o canal espiral de la cóclea es una sección del laberinto óseo del oído interno que tiene aproximadamente 30 mm de largo y da 2¾ vueltas alrededor del modiolo, el eje central de la cóclea que contiene el ganglio espiral.
Las células especializadas del oído interno incluyen: células ciliadas, células pilares, células de Boettcher, células de Claudius, neuronas del ganglio espiral y células de Deiters (células falángicas).
Las células ciliadas son las células receptoras auditivas primarias y también se conocen como células sensoriales auditivas, células ciliadas acústicas, células auditivas o células de Corti. 

El órgano de Corti está revestido con una sola fila de células ciliadas internas y tres filas de células ciliadas externas. 

Las células ciliadas tienen un haz de cabello en la superficie apical de la célula. 

El haz de cabello consiste en una serie de estereocilios basados ​​en actina. 

Cada estereocilio se inserta como una raicilla en una densa malla de actina filamentosa conocida como placa cuticular. 

La interrupción de estos haces da como resultado deficiencias auditivas y defectos del equilibrio.
Las células pilares internas y externas del órgano de Corti sostienen las células ciliadas. 

Las celdas del pilar externo son únicas porque son celdas independientes que solo están en contacto con las celdas adyacentes en las bases y los vértices. 

Ambos tipos de células pilares tienen miles de microtúbulos reticulados y filamentos de actina en orientación paralela. 

Proporcionan acoplamiento mecánico entre la membrana basal y los mecanorreceptores de las células ciliadas.
Las células de Boettcher se encuentran en el órgano de Corti, donde están presentes solo en el giro inferior de la cóclea. 

Se encuentran en la membrana basilar debajo de las células de Claudio y están organizados en filas, cuyo número varía según la especie.

Las células se interdigitan entre sí y proyectan microvellosidades en el espacio intercelular.

Son células de soporte para las células ciliadas auditivas en el órgano de Corti.

Llevan el nombre del patólogo alemán Arthur Böttcher (1831-1889).
Las células de Claudius se encuentran en el órgano de Corti ubicado encima de las filas de células de Boettcher.

Al igual que las células de Boettcher, se consideran células de apoyo para las células ciliadas auditivas del órgano de Corti.

Contienen una variedad de canales de agua de acuaporina y parecen estar involucrados en el transporte de iones.

También juegan un papel en el sellado de los espacios endolinfáticos.

Llevan el nombre del anatomista alemán Friedrich Matthias Claudius (1822-1869).
Las células de Deiters (células falángicas) son un tipo de células neurogliales que se encuentran en el órgano de Corti y están organizadas en una fila de células falángicas internas y tres filas de células falángicas externas.

Son las células de soporte del área de células ciliadas dentro de la cóclea.

Reciben su nombre del patólogo alemán Otto Deiters (1834-1863) que los describió.
Las celdas de Hensen son celdas columnares altas que están directamente adyacentes a la tercera fila de celdas de Deiters.
La raya de Hensen es la sección de la membrana tectorial sobre la célula ciliada interna.
Los espacios de Nuel se refieren a los espacios llenos de líquido entre las células del pilar externo y las células ciliadas adyacentes y también los espacios entre las células ciliadas externas.
La membrana de Hardesty es la capa de la tectoria más cercana a la lámina reticular y que recubre la región externa de las células ciliadas.
La membrana de Reissner está compuesta por dos capas de células y separa la escala media de la escala vestibular.
Los dientes de Huschke son las crestas en forma de diente en el limbo espiral que están en contacto con la tectoria y separados por células interdentales.


=== Suministro de sangre ===

El laberinto óseo recibe su riego sanguíneo de tres arterias:
1- Rama timpánica anterior (de la arteria maxilar).
2- Rama petrosa (de la arteria meníngea media).
3- Rama estilomastoidea (de la arteria auricular posterior).
El laberinto membranoso está irrigado por la arteria laberíntica.
El drenaje venoso del oído interno se realiza a través de la vena laberíntica, que desemboca en el seno sigmoideo o seno petroso inferior.


== Función ==

Las neuronas dentro del oído responden a tonos simples y el cerebro sirve para procesar otros sonidos cada vez más complejos. 

Un adulto promedio generalmente puede detectar sonidos que oscilan entre 20 y 20,000 Hz.

La capacidad de detectar sonidos de tonos más altos disminuye en los humanos mayores.
El oído humano ha evolucionado con dos herramientas básicas para codificar ondas sonoras; cada uno está separado para detectar sonidos de alta y baja frecuencia.

Georg von Békésy (1899-1972) empleó el uso de un microscopio para examinar la membrana basilar ubicada dentro del oído interno de los cadáveres.

Encontró que el movimiento de la membrana basilar se parece al de una onda viajera; cuya forma varía según la frecuencia del tono.

En los sonidos de baja frecuencia, la punta (ápice) de la membrana se mueve más, mientras que en los sonidos de alta frecuencia, la base de la membrana se mueve más.


== Trastornos ==


La interferencia o infección del laberinto puede resultar en un síndrome de dolencias llamado laberintitis.

Los síntomas de la laberintitis incluyen náuseas, desorientación, vértigo y mareos temporales. 

La laberintitis puede ser causada por infecciones virales, infecciones bacterianas o bloqueo físico del oído interno. Otra afección se conoce como enfermedad autoinmune del oído interno (AIED, por sus siglas en inglés). 

Se caracteriza por hipoacusia neurosensorial bilateral idiopática, rápidamente progresiva. 

Es un trastorno bastante raro y, al mismo tiempo, la falta de pruebas de diagnóstico adecuadas ha significado que no se puede determinar su incidencia precisa.


== Otros animales ==

Las aves tienen un sistema auditivo similar al de los mamíferos, incluida una cóclea. 

Los reptiles, los anfibios y los peces no tienen cóclea, pero escuchan con órganos auditivos u órganos vestibulares más simples, que generalmente detectan sonidos de menor frecuencia que la cóclea. 

La cóclea de las aves es similar a la de los cocodrilos y consta de un tubo óseo corto y ligeramente curvado dentro del cual se encuentra la membrana basilar con sus estructuras sensoriales.


=== Sistema coclear ===


En los reptiles, el sonido se transmite al oído interno a través del hueso del estribo (estribo) del oído medio. 

Este se presiona contra la ventana oval, una abertura cubierta por una membrana en la superficie del vestíbulo. 

Desde aquí, las ondas de sonido se conducen a través de un conducto perilinfático corto hasta una segunda abertura, la ventana redonda, que iguala la presión y permite que el fluido incompresible se mueva libremente. 

En paralelo con el conducto perilinfático hay un conducto ciego separado, la lagena, lleno de endolinfa. 

La lagena está separada del conducto perilinfático por una membrana basilar y contiene las células ciliadas sensoriales que finalmente traducen las vibraciones del líquido en señales nerviosas. 

Está unido por un extremo al sáculo. En la mayoría de los reptiles, el conducto perilinfático y la lagena son relativamente cortos, y las células sensoriales están confinadas a una pequeña papila basilar que se encuentra entre ellos. 

Sin embargo, en mamíferos, aves y cocodrilos, estas estructuras se vuelven mucho más grandes y algo más complicadas. 

En aves, cocodrilos y monotremas, los conductos simplemente se extienden, formando juntos un tubo alargado, más o menos recto. 

El conducto endolinfático se envuelve en un bucle simple alrededor de la lagena, con la membrana basilar a lo largo de un lado. 

La primera mitad del conducto ahora se denomina rampa vestibular, mientras que la segunda mitad, que incluye la membrana basilar, se denomina rampa timpánica. 

Como resultado de este aumento de longitud, la membrana basilar y la papila se extienden, y esta última se convierte en el órgano de Corti, mientras que la lagena ahora se denomina conducto coclear. 

Todas estas estructuras juntas constituyen la cóclea. En los mamíferos (aparte de los monotremas), la cóclea se extiende aún más, convirtiéndose en una estructura enrollada para acomodar su longitud dentro de la cabeza. 

El órgano de Corti también tiene una estructura más compleja en los mamíferos que en otros amniotas. La disposición del oído interno en los anfibios vivos es, en muchos aspectos, similar a la de los reptiles. 

Sin embargo, a menudo carecen de una papila basilar y, en cambio, tienen un conjunto completamente separado de células sensoriales en el borde superior del sáculo, denominado papila amphibiorum, que parecen tener la misma función. Aunque muchos peces son capaces de oír, el lagena es, en el mejor de los casos, un divertículo corto del sáculo y parece no tener ningún papel en la sensación del sonido.

En cambio, varios grupos de células ciliadas dentro del oído interno pueden ser los responsables; por ejemplo, los peces óseos contienen en el utrículo un grupo sensorial llamado mácula negligencia que puede tener esta función.

Aunque los peces no tienen oído externo ni medio, el sonido aún puede transmitirse al oído interno a través de los huesos del cráneo o de la vejiga natatoria, partes de las cuales a menudo se encuentran cerca del cuerpo.


=== Sistema vestibular ===

En comparación con el sistema coclear, el sistema vestibular varía relativamente poco entre los diversos grupos de vertebrados con mandíbula. 

La parte central del sistema consta de dos cámaras, el sáculo y el utrículo, cada una de las cuales incluye uno o dos pequeños grupos de células ciliadas sensoriales. 

Todos los vertebrados con mandíbula también poseen tres canales semicirculares que surgen del utrículo, cada uno con una ampolla que contiene células sensoriales en un extremo. Un conducto endolinfático va desde el sáculo hasta la cabeza y termina cerca del cerebro. 

En los peces cartilaginosos, este conducto en realidad se abre en la parte superior de la cabeza, y en algunos teleósteos, es simplemente un final ciego. 

En todas las demás especies, sin embargo, termina en un saco endolinfático. 

En muchos reptiles, peces y anfibios, este saco puede alcanzar un tamaño considerable. 

En los anfibios, los sacos de ambos lados pueden fusionarse en una sola estructura, que a menudo se extiende a lo largo del cuerpo, paralela al canal espinal. Las lampreas primitivas y los mixinos, sin embargo, tienen un sistema más simple. 

El oído interno en estas especies consta de una sola cámara vestibular, aunque en las lampreas está asociada con una serie de sacos revestidos por cilios. 

Las lampreas tienen solo dos canales semicirculares, sin el canal horizontal, mientras que los mixinos tienen solo un canal vertical.


=== Equilibrio ===

El oído interno es el principal responsable del equilibrio, el equilibrio y la orientación en el espacio tridimensional. 

El oído interno puede detectar tanto el equilibrio estático como el dinámico. 

Tres conductos semicirculares y dos cámaras, que contienen el sáculo y el utrículo, permiten al cuerpo detectar cualquier desviación del equilibrio. 

La macula sacculi detecta la aceleración vertical mientras que la macula utriculi es responsable de la aceleración horizontal. 

Estas estructuras microscópicas poseen estereocilios y un cinocilio que se encuentran dentro de la membrana otolítica gelatinosa. 

La membrana se carga aún más con otolitos. 

El movimiento de los estereocilios y el kinocilio permite que las células ciliadas del sáculo y el utrículo detecten el movimiento. 

Los conductos semicirculares son los encargados de detectar el movimiento de rotación.

OREILLE INTERNE


L'oreille interne (oreille interne, auris interne) est la partie la plus interne de l'oreille des vertébrés.

Chez les vertébrés, l'oreille interne est principalement responsable de la détection et de l'équilibre des sons.

Chez les mammifères, il est constitué du labyrinthe osseux, une cavité creuse dans l'os temporal du crâne avec un système de passages comprenant deux parties fonctionnelles principales :
La cochlée, dédiée à l'ouïe ; convertir les modèles de pression sonore de l'oreille externe en impulsions électrochimiques qui sont transmises au cerveau via le nerf auditif.
Le système vestibulaire, dédié à l'équilibreL'oreille interne se retrouve chez tous les vertébrés, avec des variations substantielles de forme et de fonction.

L'oreille interne est innervée par le huitième nerf crânien chez tous les vertébrés.


== Structure ==


Le labyrinthe peut être divisé par couche ou par région.


=== Labyrinthes osseux et membraneux ===

Le labyrinthe osseux, ou labyrinthe osseux, est le réseau de passages aux parois osseuses tapissées de périoste.

Les trois parties principales du labyrinthe osseux sont le vestibule de l'oreille, les canaux semi-circulaires et la cochlée.

Le labyrinthe membraneux s'étend à l'intérieur du labyrinthe osseux et crée trois espaces parallèles remplis de fluide.

Les deux externes sont remplis de périlymphe et l'intérieur d'endolymphe.


=== Systèmes vestibulaire et cochléaire ===

Dans l'oreille moyenne, l'énergie des ondes de pression est traduite en vibrations mécaniques par les trois osselets auditifs.

Les ondes de pression déplacent la membrane tympanique qui à son tour déplace le marteau, le premier os de l'oreille moyenne.

Le marteau s'articule à l'incus qui se connecte à l'étrier.

La plaque de base de l'étrier se connecte à la fenêtre ovale, le début de l'oreille interne.

Lorsque l'étrier appuie sur la fenêtre ovale, il provoque le déplacement de la périlymphe, le liquide de l'oreille interne.

L'oreille moyenne sert ainsi à convertir l'énergie des ondes de pression acoustique en une force sur la périlymphe de l'oreille interne.

La fenêtre ovale n'a qu'environ 1/18 de la surface de la membrane tympanique et produit ainsi une pression plus élevée.

La cochlée propage ces signaux mécaniques sous forme d'ondes dans le liquide et les membranes, puis les convertit en impulsions nerveuses qui sont transmises au cerveau. Le système vestibulaire est la région de l'oreille interne où convergent les canaux semi-circulaires, près de la cochlée.

Le système vestibulaire fonctionne avec le système visuel pour garder les objets en vue lorsque la tête est déplacée.

Les récepteurs articulaires et musculaires jouent également un rôle important dans le maintien de l'équilibre.

Le cerveau reçoit, interprète et traite les informations de tous ces systèmes pour créer la sensation d'équilibre.
Le système vestibulaire de l'oreille interne est responsable des sensations d'équilibre et de mouvement.

Il utilise les mêmes types de fluides et de cellules de détection (cellules ciliées) que la cochlée et envoie des informations au cerveau sur l'attitude, la rotation et le mouvement linéaire de la tête.

Le type de mouvement ou d'attitude détecté par une cellule ciliée dépend de ses structures mécaniques associées, telles que le tube incurvé d'un canal semi-circulaire ou les cristaux de carbonate de calcium (otolithe) du saccule et de l'utricule.


=== Développement ===

L'oreille interne humaine se développe au cours de la semaine 4 du développement embryonnaire à partir de la placode auditive, un épaississement de l'ectoderme qui donne naissance aux neurones bipolaires des ganglions cochléaires et vestibulaires. 

Au fur et à mesure que la placode auditive s'invagine vers le mésoderme embryonnaire, elle forme la vésicule auditive ou otocyste.
La vésicule auditive donnera naissance aux composants utriculaire et sacculaire du labyrinthe membraneux. 

Ils contiennent les cellules ciliées sensorielles et les otolithes de la macula de l'utricule et du saccule, respectivement, qui répondent à l'accélération linéaire et à la force de gravité. 

La division utriculaire de la vésicule auditive répond également à l'accélération angulaire, ainsi que le sac endolymphatique et le conduit qui relient le saccule et l'utricule.
À partir de la cinquième semaine de développement, la vésicule auditive donne également naissance au canal cochléaire, qui contient l'organe spiral de Corti et l'endolymphe qui s'accumule dans le labyrinthe membraneux. 

La paroi vestibulaire séparera le canal cochléaire de la rampe vestibulaire périlymphatique, une cavité à l'intérieur de la cochlée. 

La membrane basilaire sépare le canal cochléaire de la rampe tympanique, une cavité dans le labyrinthe cochléaire. 

La paroi latérale du canal cochléaire est formée par le ligament spiral et la strie vasculaire, qui produit l'endolymphe. 

Les cellules ciliées se développent à partir des crêtes latérale et médiale du canal cochléaire, qui, avec la membrane tectoriale, constituent l'organe de Corti.


=== Microanatomie ===


Le canal de Rosenthal ou canal spiral de la cochlée est une section du labyrinthe osseux de l'oreille interne qui mesure environ 30 mm de long et fait 2¾ tours autour du modiolus, l'axe central de la cochlée qui contient le ganglion spiral.
Les cellules spécialisées de l'oreille interne comprennent : les cellules ciliées, les cellules piliers, les cellules de Boettcher, les cellules de Claudius, les neurones du ganglion spiral et les cellules de Deiters (cellules phalangiennes).
Les cellules ciliées sont les principales cellules réceptrices auditives et elles sont également appelées cellules sensorielles auditives, cellules ciliées acoustiques, cellules auditives ou cellules de Corti.

L'organe de Corti est tapissé d'une seule rangée de cellules ciliées internes et de trois rangées de cellules ciliées externes.

Les cellules ciliées ont un faisceau de cheveux à la surface apicale de la cellule. 

Le faisceau de cheveux se compose d'un ensemble de stéréocils à base d'actine. 

Chaque stéréocil s'insère comme une radicelle dans un maillage d'actine filamenteux dense connu sous le nom de plaque cuticulaire. 

La perturbation de ces faisceaux entraîne des déficiences auditives et des troubles de l'équilibre.
Les cellules piliers internes et externes de l'organe de Corti soutiennent les cellules ciliées. 

Les cellules des piliers externes sont uniques car ce sont des cellules autonomes qui ne contactent que les cellules adjacentes aux bases et aux sommets. 

Les deux types de cellules piliers ont des milliers de microtubules réticulés et de filaments d'actine en orientation parallèle. 

Ils assurent un couplage mécanique entre la membrane basale et les mécanorécepteurs des cellules ciliées.
Les cellules de Boettcher se trouvent dans l'organe de Corti où elles ne sont présentes que dans le tour inférieur de la cochlée. 

Ils reposent sur la membrane basilaire sous les cellules de Claudius et sont organisés en rangées, dont le nombre varie selon les espèces.

Les cellules s'interdigitent et projettent des microvillosités dans l'espace intercellulaire.

Ce sont des cellules de soutien pour les cellules ciliées auditives dans l'organe de Corti.

Ils portent le nom du pathologiste allemand Arthur Böttcher (1831-1889).
Les cellules de Claudius se trouvent dans l'organe de Corti situé au-dessus des rangées de cellules de Boettcher.

Comme les cellules de Boettcher, elles sont considérées comme des cellules de soutien pour les cellules ciliées auditives dans l'organe de Corti.

Ils contiennent une variété de canaux d'eau aquaporine et semblent être impliqués dans le transport des ions.

Ils jouent également un rôle dans l'obturation des espaces endolymphatiques.

Ils portent le nom de l'anatomiste allemand Friedrich Matthias Claudius (1822-1869).
Les cellules de Deiters (cellules phalangiennes) sont un type de cellule neurogliale trouvée dans l'organe de Corti et organisées en une rangée de cellules phalangiennes internes et trois rangées de cellules phalangiennes externes. 

Ce sont les cellules de soutien de la zone des cellules ciliées dans la cochlée. 

Ils portent le nom du pathologiste allemand Otto Deiters (1834-1863) qui les a décrits.
Les cellules de Hensen sont des cellules cylindriques hautes qui sont directement adjacentes à la troisième rangée de cellules de Deiters.
La bande de Hensen est la section de la membrane tectoriale au-dessus de la cellule ciliée interne.
Les espaces de Nuel font référence aux espaces remplis de liquide entre les cellules piliers externes et les cellules ciliées adjacentes, ainsi qu'aux espaces entre les cellules ciliées externes.
La membrane de Hardesty est la couche de la tectoria la plus proche de la lame réticulaire et recouvrant la région externe des cellules ciliées.
La membrane de Reissner est composée de deux couches cellulaires et sépare la rampe médiane de la rampe vestibulaire.
Les dents de Huschke sont les crêtes en forme de dent sur le limbe en spirale qui sont en contact avec la tectoria et séparées par des cellules interdentaires.


=== Approvisionnement en sang ===

Le labyrinthe osseux reçoit son apport sanguin de trois artères :
1- Branche tympanique antérieure (provenant de l'artère maxillaire).
2- Branche pétrosale (provenant de l'artère méningée moyenne).
3- Branche stylomastoïdienne (provenant de l'artère auriculaire postérieure).
Le labyrinthe membraneux est alimenté par l'artère labyrinthique.
Le drainage veineux de l'oreille interne se fait par la veine labyrinthique, qui se jette dans le sinus sigmoïde ou le sinus pétreux inférieur.


== Fonction ==

Les neurones de l'oreille réagissent à des sons simples et le cerveau sert à traiter d'autres sons de plus en plus complexes. 

Un adulte moyen est généralement capable de détecter des sons compris entre 20 et 20 000 Hz.

La capacité à détecter les sons aigus diminue chez les personnes âgées.
L'oreille humaine a évolué avec deux outils de base pour coder les ondes sonores ; chacun est séparé dans la détection des sons haute et basse fréquence.

Georg von Békésy (1899-1972) a utilisé un microscope pour examiner la membrane basilaire située dans l'oreille interne des cadavres.

Il a constaté que le mouvement de la membrane basilaire ressemble à celui d'une onde progressive ; dont la forme varie en fonction de la fréquence du pitch.

Dans les sons à basse fréquence, la pointe (apex) de la membrane bouge le plus, tandis que dans les sons à haute fréquence, la base de la membrane bouge le plus.


== Troubles ==


L'interférence ou l'infection du labyrinthe peut entraîner un syndrome de maladies appelé labyrinthite.

Les symptômes de la labyrinthite comprennent des nausées temporaires, une désorientation, des vertiges et des étourdissements.

La labyrinthite peut être causée par des infections virales, des infections bactériennes ou un blocage physique de l'oreille interne. Une autre condition est connue sous le nom de maladie auto-immune de l'oreille interne (AIED).

Elle se caractérise par une surdité neurosensorielle idiopathique, rapidement évolutive, bilatérale.

C'est un trouble assez rare alors qu'en même temps, un manque de tests diagnostiques appropriés signifie que son incidence précise ne peut pas être déterminée.


== Autres animaux ==

Les oiseaux ont un système auditif similaire à celui des mammifères, y compris une cochlée.

Les reptiles, les amphibiens et les poissons n'ont pas de cochlée mais entendent avec des organes auditifs ou des organes vestibulaires plus simples, qui détectent généralement les sons de basse fréquence que la cochlée.

La cochlée des oiseaux est similaire à celle des crocodiles, constituée d'un court tube osseux légèrement incurvé à l'intérieur duquel se trouve la membrane basilaire avec ses structures sensorielles.


=== Système cochléaire ===


Chez les reptiles, le son est transmis à l'oreille interne par l'os de l'étrier (étrier) de l'oreille moyenne.

Celui-ci est pressé contre la fenêtre ovale, une ouverture recouverte d'une membrane à la surface du vestibule.

De là, les ondes sonores sont conduites à travers un court conduit périlymphatique vers une deuxième ouverture, la fenêtre ronde, qui égalise la pression, permettant au fluide incompressible de se déplacer librement.

Parallèlement au canal périlymphatique se trouve un canal aveugle séparé, le lagena, rempli d'endolymphe.

La lagena est séparée du canal périlymphatique par une membrane basilaire et contient les cellules ciliées sensorielles qui traduisent finalement les vibrations du fluide en signaux nerveux.

Il est attaché à une extrémité au saccule. Chez la plupart des reptiles, le conduit périlymphatique et la lagena sont relativement courts et les cellules sensorielles sont confinées à une petite papille basilaire située entre eux.

Cependant, chez les mammifères, les oiseaux et les crocodiliens, ces structures deviennent beaucoup plus grandes et un peu plus compliquées.

Chez les oiseaux, les crocodiliens et les monotrèmes, les conduits sont simplement prolongés, formant ensemble un tube allongé, plus ou moins droit.

Le canal endolymphatique est enroulé dans une simple boucle autour de la lagena, la membrane basilaire se trouvant le long d'un côté.

La première moitié du conduit est maintenant appelée rampe vestibulaire, tandis que la seconde moitié, qui comprend la membrane basilaire, est appelée rampe tympanique.

À la suite de cette augmentation de longueur, la membrane basilaire et la papille sont toutes deux étendues, cette dernière se développant dans l'organe de Corti, tandis que la lagena est maintenant appelée le canal cochléaire.

Toutes ces structures constituent ensemble la cochlée. Chez les mammifères (autres que les monotrèmes), la cochlée est encore plus étendue, devenant une structure enroulée afin de s'adapter à sa longueur dans la tête.

L'organe de Corti a également une structure plus complexe chez les mammifères que chez les autres amniotes. La disposition de l'oreille interne chez les amphibiens vivants est, à bien des égards, similaire à celle des reptiles.

Cependant, ils manquent souvent d'une papille basilaire, ayant à la place un ensemble entièrement séparé de cellules sensorielles au bord supérieur du saccule, appelée papille amphibiorum, qui semblent avoir la même fonction.Bien que de nombreux poissons soient capables d'entendre, le lagena est, au mieux, un court diverticule du saccule, et semble n'avoir aucun rôle dans la sensation du son.

Divers groupes de cellules ciliées dans l'oreille interne peuvent plutôt être responsables ; par exemple, les poissons osseux contiennent un groupe sensoriel appelé macula negligea dans l'utricule qui peut avoir cette fonction.

Bien que les poissons n'aient ni oreille externe ni oreille moyenne, le son peut toujours être transmis à l'oreille interne par les os du crâne ou par la vessie natatoire, dont certaines parties se trouvent souvent à proximité dans le corps.


=== Système vestibulaire ===

Par rapport au système cochléaire, le système vestibulaire varie relativement peu entre les différents groupes de vertébrés à mâchoires. 

La partie centrale du système se compose de deux chambres, le saccule et l'utricule, dont chacune comprend un ou deux petits groupes de cellules ciliées sensorielles. 

Tous les vertébrés à mâchoires possèdent également trois canaux semi-circulaires issus de l'utricule, chacun avec une ampoule contenant des cellules sensorielles à une extrémité. Un canal endolymphatique part du saccule jusqu'à la tête et se termine près du cerveau. 

Chez les poissons cartilagineux, ce conduit s'ouvre en fait sur le dessus de la tête, et chez certains téléostéens, il se termine simplement en aveugle. 

Chez toutes les autres espèces, cependant, il se termine par un sac endolymphatique. 

Chez de nombreux reptiles, poissons et amphibiens, ce sac peut atteindre une taille considérable. 

Chez les amphibiens, les sacs de chaque côté peuvent fusionner en une seule structure, qui s'étend souvent sur toute la longueur du corps, parallèlement au canal rachidien. Les lamproies et myxines primitives, cependant, ont un système plus simple. 

L'oreille interne de ces espèces se compose d'une seule chambre vestibulaire, bien que chez les lamproies, celle-ci soit associée à une série de sacs bordés de cils. 

Les lamproies n'ont que deux canaux semi-circulaires, le canal horizontal étant absent, tandis que la myxine n'a qu'un seul canal vertical.


=== Équilibre ===

L'oreille interne est principalement responsable de l'équilibre, de l'équilibre et de l'orientation dans l'espace tridimensionnel. 

L'oreille interne peut détecter à la fois l'équilibre statique et dynamique. 

Trois canaux semi-circulaires et deux chambres, qui contiennent le saccule et l'utricule, permettent à l'organisme de détecter tout écart par rapport à l'équilibre. 

La macula sacculi détecte l'accélération verticale tandis que la macula utriculi est responsable de l'accélération horizontale. 

Ces structures microscopiques possèdent des stéréocils et un kinocilium situés dans la membrane otolithique gélatineuse. 

La membrane est en outre lestée d'otolithes. 

Le mouvement des stéréocils et du kinocilium permet aux cellules ciliées du saccule et de l'utricule de détecter le mouvement. 

Les conduits semi-circulaires sont responsables de la détection des mouvements de rotation.

OUVIDO INTERNO


O ouvido interno (ouvido interno, auris interno) é a parte mais interna do ouvido dos vertebrados. 

Nos vertebrados, o ouvido interno é o principal responsável pela detecção do som e pelo equilíbrio. 

Nos mamíferos, consiste no labirinto ósseo, uma cavidade oca no osso temporal do crânio com um sistema de passagens que compreende duas partes funcionais principais:
A cóclea, dedicada à audição; converter padrões de pressão sonora do ouvido externo em impulsos eletroquímicos que são transmitidos ao cérebro através do nervo auditivo.
O sistema vestibular, dedicado ao equilíbrioA orelha interna é encontrada em todos os vertebrados, com variações substanciais na forma e função. 

A orelha interna é inervada pelo oitavo nervo craniano em todos os vertebrados.


== Estrutura ==


O labirinto pode ser dividido por camada ou por região.


=== Labirintos ósseos e membranosos ===

O labirinto ósseo, ou labirinto ósseo, é a rede de passagens com paredes ósseas revestidas de periósteo. 

As três partes principais do labirinto ósseo são o vestíbulo da orelha, os canais semicirculares e a cóclea. 

O labirinto membranoso corre dentro do labirinto ósseo e cria três espaços paralelos preenchidos por fluido. 

As duas externas são preenchidas com perilinfa e as internas com endolinfa.


=== Sistemas vestibular e coclear ===

No ouvido médio, a energia das ondas de pressão é traduzida em vibrações mecânicas pelos três ossículos auditivos. 

As ondas de pressão movem a membrana timpânica que, por sua vez, move o martelo, o primeiro osso do ouvido médio. 

O martelo se articula com a bigorna que se conecta ao estribo. 

A platina do estribo se conecta à janela oval, o início do ouvido interno. 

Quando o estribo pressiona a janela oval, faz com que a perilinfa, o líquido do ouvido interno, se mova. 

O ouvido médio serve para converter a energia das ondas de pressão sonora em uma força sobre a perilinfa do ouvido interno. 

A janela oval tem apenas aproximadamente 1/18 da área da membrana timpânica e, portanto, produz uma pressão mais alta. 

A cóclea propaga esses sinais mecânicos como ondas no fluido e nas membranas e os converte em impulsos nervosos que são transmitidos ao cérebro. O sistema vestibular é a região do ouvido interno para onde convergem os canais semicirculares, próximo à cóclea. 

O sistema vestibular trabalha com o sistema visual para manter os objetos à vista quando a cabeça é movida. 

Os receptores articulares e musculares também são importantes na manutenção do equilíbrio. 

O cérebro recebe, interpreta e processa as informações de todos esses sistemas para criar a sensação de equilíbrio.
O sistema vestibular do ouvido interno é responsável pelas sensações de equilíbrio e movimento. 

Ele usa os mesmos tipos de fluidos e células de detecção (células ciliadas) que a cóclea usa e envia informações ao cérebro sobre a atitude, rotação e movimento linear da cabeça. 

O tipo de movimento ou atitude detectado por uma célula ciliada depende de suas estruturas mecânicas associadas, como o tubo curvo de um canal semicircular ou os cristais de carbonato de cálcio (otólitos) do sáculo e do utrículo.


=== Desenvolvimento ===

O ouvido interno humano desenvolve-se durante a semana 4 do desenvolvimento embrionário a partir do placódio auditivo, um espessamento do ectoderma que dá origem aos neurônios bipolares dos gânglios cocleares e vestibulares. 

À medida que o placódio auditivo invagina em direção ao mesoderma embrionário, forma a vesícula auditiva ou otocisto.
A vesícula auditiva dará origem aos componentes utricular e sacular do labirinto membranoso. 

Eles contêm as células ciliadas sensoriais e os otólitos da mácula do utrículo e do sáculo, respectivamente, que respondem à aceleração linear e à força da gravidade. 

A divisão utricular da vesícula auditiva também responde à aceleração angular, assim como o saco endolinfático e o ducto que conectam o sáculo e o utrículo.
A partir da quinta semana de desenvolvimento, a vesícula auditiva também dá origem ao ducto coclear, que contém o órgão espiral de Corti e a endolinfa que se acumula no labirinto membranoso. 

A parede vestibular separará o ducto coclear da rampa vestibular perilinfática, uma cavidade dentro da cóclea. 

A membrana basilar separa o ducto coclear da rampa timpânica, uma cavidade dentro do labirinto coclear. 

A parede lateral do ducto coclear é formada pelo ligamento espiral e pela estria vascular, que produz a endolinfa. 

As células ciliadas se desenvolvem a partir das cristas lateral e medial do ducto coclear, que juntamente com a membrana tectorial formam o órgão de Corti.


=== Microanatomia ===


O canal de Rosenthal ou canal espiral da cóclea é uma seção do labirinto ósseo da orelha interna que tem aproximadamente 30 mm de comprimento e faz 2¾ de voltas em torno do modíolo, o eixo central da cóclea que contém o gânglio espiral.
As células especializadas do ouvido interno incluem: células ciliadas, células pilares, células de Boettcher, células de Cláudio, neurônios do gânglio espiral e células de Deiters (células falangeanas).
As células ciliadas são as células receptoras auditivas primárias e também são conhecidas como células sensoriais auditivas, células ciliadas acústicas, células auditivas ou células de Corti.

O órgão de Corti é revestido com uma única fileira de células ciliadas internas e três fileiras de células ciliadas externas.

As células ciliadas têm um feixe de cabelo na superfície apical da célula. 

O feixe de cabelo consiste em uma matriz de estereocílios baseados em actina. 

Cada estereocílio se insere como uma radícula em uma densa malha filamentosa de actina conhecida como placa cuticular. 

A interrupção desses pacotes resulta em deficiências auditivas e defeitos de equilíbrio.
As células pilares internas e externas do órgão de Corti sustentam as células ciliadas. 

As células do pilar externo são únicas porque são células independentes que apenas entram em contato com células adjacentes nas bases e ápices. 

Ambos os tipos de células pilar têm milhares de microtúbulos reticulados e filamentos de actina em orientação paralela. 

Eles fornecem acoplamento mecânico entre a membrana basal e os mecanorreceptores nas células ciliadas.
As células de Boettcher são encontradas no órgão de Corti, onde estão presentes apenas na volta inferior da cóclea. 

Eles ficam na membrana basilar abaixo das células de Cláudio e são organizados em fileiras, cujo número varia entre as espécies.

As células se interdigitam e projetam microvilosidades no espaço intercelular.

Eles são células de suporte para as células ciliadas auditivas no órgão de Corti.

Eles são nomeados após o patologista alemão Arthur Böttcher (1831-1889).
As células de Cláudio são encontradas no órgão de Corti localizado acima das fileiras das células de Boettcher.

Assim como as células de Boettcher, são consideradas células de sustentação das células ciliadas auditivas do órgão de Corti.

Eles contêm uma variedade de canais de água de aquaporina e parecem estar envolvidos no transporte de íons.

Eles também desempenham um papel na vedação dos espaços endolinfáticos.

Eles são nomeados após o anatomista alemão Friedrich Matthias Claudius (1822-1869).
As células de Deiters (células falangeanas) são um tipo de célula neuroglial encontrada no órgão de Corti e organizada em uma fileira de células falangeanas internas e três fileiras de células falangeanas externas. 

Eles são as células de suporte da área de células ciliadas dentro da cóclea. 

Eles são nomeados após o patologista alemão Otto Deiters (1834-1863) que os descreveu.
As células de Hensen são células colunares altas que são diretamente adjacentes à terceira linha das células de Deiters.
A faixa de Hensen é a seção da membrana tectória acima da célula ciliada interna.
Os espaços de Nuel referem-se aos espaços cheios de fluido entre as células do pilar externo e as células ciliadas adjacentes e também os espaços entre as células ciliadas externas.
A membrana de Hardesty é a camada da tectoria mais próxima da lâmina reticular e que recobre a região externa das células ciliadas.
A membrana de Reissner é composta por duas camadas de células e separa a escala média da escala vestibular.
Os dentes de Huschke são as cristas em forma de dente no limbo espiral que estão em contato com as tectárias e separadas por células interdentais.


=== Suprimento sanguíneo ===

O labirinto ósseo recebe seu suprimento sanguíneo de três artérias:
1- Ramo timpânico anterior (da artéria maxilar).
2- Ramo petroso (da artéria meníngea média).
3- Ramo estilomastóideo (da artéria auricular posterior).
O labirinto membranoso é suprido pela artéria labiríntica.
A drenagem venosa da orelha interna é feita pela veia labiríntica, que desemboca no seio sigmóide ou seio petroso inferior.


== Função ==

Os neurônios dentro do ouvido respondem a tons simples, e o cérebro serve para processar outros sons cada vez mais complexos. 

Um adulto médio é tipicamente capaz de detectar sons que variam entre 20 e 20.000 Hz.

A capacidade de detectar sons mais agudos diminui em humanos mais velhos.
O ouvido humano evoluiu com duas ferramentas básicas para codificar as ondas sonoras; cada um é separado na detecção de sons de alta e baixa frequência.

Georg von Békésy (1899-1972) empregou o uso de um microscópio para examinar a membrana basilar localizada dentro do ouvido interno de cadáveres.

Ele descobriu que o movimento da membrana basilar se assemelha ao de uma onda viajante; cuja forma varia com base na frequência do tom.

Nos sons de baixa frequência, a ponta (ápice) da membrana se move mais, enquanto nos sons de alta frequência, a base da membrana se move mais.


== Distúrbios ==


A interferência ou infecção do labirinto pode resultar em uma síndrome de doenças chamada labirintite.

Os sintomas da labirintite incluem náusea temporária, desorientação, vertigem e tontura.

A labirintite pode ser causada por infecções virais, infecções bacterianas ou bloqueio físico do ouvido interno. Outra condição passou a ser conhecida como doença autoimune do ouvido interno (AIED).

Caracteriza-se por perda auditiva neurossensorial bilateral, idiopática, rapidamente progressiva.

É um distúrbio bastante raro e, ao mesmo tempo, a falta de testes diagnósticos adequados significa que sua incidência precisa não pode ser determinada.


== Outros animais ==

As aves têm um sistema auditivo semelhante ao dos mamíferos, incluindo uma cóclea.

Répteis, anfíbios e peixes não têm cócleas, mas ouvem com órgãos auditivos ou órgãos vestibulares mais simples, que geralmente detectam sons de frequência mais baixa do que a cóclea.

A cóclea das aves é semelhante à dos crocodilos, consistindo de um tubo ósseo curto e ligeiramente curvo dentro do qual se encontra a membrana basilar com suas estruturas sensoriais.


=== Sistema coclear ===


Nos répteis, o som é transmitido ao ouvido interno pelo osso do estribo (estribo) do ouvido médio. 

Este é pressionado contra a janela oval, uma abertura coberta de membrana na superfície do vestíbulo. 

A partir daqui, as ondas sonoras são conduzidas através de um pequeno ducto perilinfático até uma segunda abertura, a janela redonda, que equaliza a pressão, permitindo que o fluido incompressível se mova livremente. 

Correndo paralelamente ao ducto perilinfático, há um ducto de terminação cega separado, o lagena, preenchido com endolinfa. 

A lagena é separada do ducto perilinfático por uma membrana basilar e contém as células ciliadas sensoriais que finalmente traduzem as vibrações do fluido em sinais nervosos. 

Está ligado em uma extremidade ao sáculo. Na maioria dos répteis, o ducto perilinfático e a lagena são relativamente curtos, e as células sensoriais estão confinadas a uma pequena papila basilar situada entre eles. 

No entanto, em mamíferos, pássaros e crocodilianos, essas estruturas se tornam muito maiores e um pouco mais complicadas. 

Nas aves, crocodilianos e monotremados, os dutos são simplesmente estendidos, formando um tubo alongado, mais ou menos reto. 

O ducto endolinfático é enrolado em uma alça simples ao redor da lagena, com a membrana basilar ao longo de um lado. 

A primeira metade do ducto é agora chamada de rampa vestibular, enquanto a segunda metade, que inclui a membrana basilar, é chamada de rampa timpânica. 

Como resultado desse aumento de comprimento, a membrana basilar e a papila são estendidas, com a última se desenvolvendo no órgão de Corti, enquanto a lagena é agora chamada de ducto coclear. 

Todas essas estruturas juntas constituem a cóclea. Nos mamíferos (exceto monotremados), a cóclea se estende ainda mais, tornando-se uma estrutura enrolada para acomodar seu comprimento dentro da cabeça. 

O órgão de Corti também tem uma estrutura mais complexa em mamíferos do que em outros amniotas. O arranjo do ouvido interno em anfíbios vivos é, em muitos aspectos, semelhante ao dos répteis. 

No entanto, muitas vezes eles não têm uma papila basilar, tendo em vez disso um conjunto totalmente separado de células sensoriais na borda superior do sáculo, referido como papilla amphibiorum, que parecem ter a mesma função. lagena é, na melhor das hipóteses, um divertículo curto do sáculo e parece não ter nenhum papel na sensação de som. 

Vários aglomerados de células ciliadas dentro do ouvido interno podem ser responsáveis; por exemplo, os peixes ósseos contêm um aglomerado sensorial chamado mácula negligente no utrículo que pode ter essa função.

Embora os peixes não tenham ouvido externo nem médio, o som ainda pode ser transmitido para o ouvido interno através dos ossos do crânio ou pela bexiga natatória, cujas partes geralmente ficam próximas ao corpo.


=== Sistema vestibular ===

Em comparação com o sistema coclear, o sistema vestibular varia relativamente pouco entre os vários grupos de vertebrados maxilares. 

A parte central do sistema consiste em duas câmaras, o sáculo e o utrículo, cada uma das quais inclui um ou dois pequenos aglomerados de células ciliadas sensoriais. 

Todos os vertebrados com mandíbula também possuem três canais semicirculares que surgem do utrículo, cada um com uma ampola contendo células sensoriais em uma extremidade. Um ducto endolinfático corre do sáculo até a cabeça e termina perto do cérebro. 

Em peixes cartilaginosos, esse duto realmente se abre no topo da cabeça e, em alguns teleósteos, é simplesmente cego. 

Em todas as outras espécies, no entanto, termina em um saco endolinfático. 

Em muitos répteis, peixes e anfíbios este saco pode atingir um tamanho considerável. 

Nos anfíbios, os sacos de ambos os lados podem se fundir em uma única estrutura, que muitas vezes se estende ao longo do corpo, paralela ao canal espinhal. As lampreias primitivas e os peixes-bruxa, no entanto, têm um sistema mais simples. 

O ouvido interno nestas espécies é constituído por uma única câmara vestibular, embora nas lampreias esteja associada a uma série de sacos revestidos por cílios. 

As lampreias têm apenas dois canais semicirculares, com o canal horizontal ausente, enquanto os peixes-bruxa têm apenas um único canal vertical.


=== Equilíbrio ===

O ouvido interno é o principal responsável pelo equilíbrio, equilíbrio e orientação no espaço tridimensional. 

O ouvido interno pode detectar o equilíbrio estático e dinâmico. 

Três ductos semicirculares e duas câmaras, que contêm o sáculo e o utrículo, permitem que o corpo detecte qualquer desvio do equilíbrio. 

A mácula sacculi detecta a aceleração vertical enquanto a mácula utrícula é responsável pela aceleração horizontal.

Essas estruturas microscópicas possuem estereocílios e um cinocílio que estão localizados dentro da membrana otolítica gelatinosa.

A membrana é ainda pesada com otólitos.

O movimento dos estereocílios e do cinocílio permite que as células ciliadas do sáculo e do utrículo detectem movimento.

Os ductos semicirculares são responsáveis ​​por detectar o movimento rotacional.
