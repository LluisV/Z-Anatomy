TRACHEA


The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in almost all air-breathing animals with lungs. 

The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary bronchi. 

At the top of the trachea the cricoid cartilage attaches it to the larynx. 

The trachea is formed by a number of horseshoe-shaped rings, joined together vertically by overlying ligaments, and by the trachealis muscle at their ends. 

The epiglottis closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing.
The trachea begins to form in the second month of embryo development, becoming longer and more fixed in its position over time. 

It is epithelium lined with column-shaped cells that have hair-like extensions called cilia, with scattered goblet cells that produce protective mucins. 

The trachea can be affected by inflammation or infection, usually as a result of a viral illness affecting other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, called croup, that can result in a barking cough. 

Infection with bacteria usually affects the trachea only and can cause narrowing or even obstruction. 

As a major part of the respiratory tract, when obstructed the trachea prevents air entering the lungs and so a tracheostomy may be required if the trachea is obstructed. 

Additionally, during surgery if mechanical ventilation is required when a person is sedated, a tube is inserted into the trachea, called intubation.

The word trachea is used to define a very different organ in invertebrates than in vertebrates. 

Insects have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues.


== Structure ==


An adult's trachea has an inner diameter of about 1.5 to 2 centimetres (0.59 to 0.79 in) and a length of about 10 to 11 centimetres (3.9 to 4.3 in); wider in males than females. 

It begins at the bottom of the larynx and ends at the carina, the point where the trachea branches into the left and right main bronchi. 

The trachea is surrounded by 16–20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these 'rings' are 4 millimetres high in the adult, incomplete and C-shaped. 

Ligaments connect the rings. 

The trachealis muscle connects the ends of the incomplete rings and runs along the back wall of the trachea. 

Also adventitia, which is the outermost layer of connective tissue that surrounds the hyaline cartilage, contributes to the trachea's ability to bend and stretch with movement.

The trachea begins at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx and ends at the carina, the point where the trachea branches into left and right main bronchi. 

The trachea begins level with the sixth cervical vertebra (C6), and the carina is found at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4), although its position may change with breathing.


=== Nearby structures ===

The trachea passes by many structures of the neck and chest (thorax) along its course.
In front of the upper trachea lies connective tissue and skin. 

Several other structures pass over or sit on the trachea; the jugular arch, which joins the two anterior jugular veins, sits in front of the upper part of the trachea. 

The sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles stretch along its length. 

The thyroid gland also stretches across the upper trachea, with the isthmus overlying the second to fourth rings, and the lobes stretching to the level of the fifth or sixth cartilage. 

The blood vessels of the thyroid rest on the trachea next to the isthmus; superior thyroid arteries join just above it, and the inferior thyroid veins below it. 

In front of the lower trachea lies the manubrium of the sternum, the remnants of the thymus in adults. 

To the front left lie the large blood vessels the aortic arch and its branches the left common carotid artery and the brachiocephalic trunk; and the left brachiocephalic vein. 

The deep cardiac plexus and lymph nodes are also positioned in front of the lower trachea.Behind the trachea, along its length, sits the oesophagus, followed by connective tissue and the vertebral column. 

To its sides run the carotid arteries and inferior thyroid arteries; and to its sides on its back surface run the recurrent laryngeal nerves in the upper trachea, and the vagus nerves in the lower trachea.

The trachealis muscle contracts during coughing, reducing the size of the lumen of the trachea.

		


=== Blood and lymphatic supply ===


The upper part of trachea receives and drains blood through the inferior thyroid arteries and veins; the lower trachea receives blood from bronchial arteries. 

Arteries that supply the trachea do so via small branches that supply the trachea from the sides. 

As the branches approach the wall of the trachea, they split into inferior and superior branches, which join with the branches of the arteries above and below; these then split into branches that supply the anterior and posterior parts of the trachea. 

The inferior thyroid arteries arise just below the isthmus of the thyroid, which sits atop the trachea. 

These arteries join (anastamoses) with ascending branches of the bronchial arteries, which are direct branches from the aorta, to supply blood to the trachea. 

The lymphatic vessels of the trachea drain into the pretracheal nodes that lie in front of the trachea, and paratracheal lymph nodes that lie beside it.


=== Development ===

In the fourth week of development of the human embryo as the respiratory bud grows, the trachea separates from the foregut through the formation of ridges which eventually separate the trachea from the oesophagus, the tracheoesophageal septum. 

This separates the future trachea from the oesophagus and divides the foregut tube into the laryngotracheal tube. 

By the start of the fifth week, the left and right main bronchi have begin to form, initially as buds at the terminal end of the trachea.The trachea is no more than 4mm diameter during the first year of life, expanding to its adult diameter of approximately 2cm by late childhood. 

The trachea is more circular and more vertical in children compared to adults, varies more in size, and also varies more in its position in relation to its surrounding structures.


=== Microanatomy ===

The trachea is lined with a layer of interspersed layers of column-shaped cells with cilia. 

The epithelium contains goblet cells, which are glandular, column-shaped cells that produce mucins, the main component of mucus. 

Mucus helps to moisten and protect the airways. 

Mucus lines the ciliated cells of the trachea to trap inhaled foreign particles that the cilia then waft upward toward the larynx and then the pharynx where it can be either swallowed into the stomach or expelled as phlegm. 

This self-clearing mechanism is termed mucociliary clearance.The trachea is surrounded by 16 to 20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these 'rings' are incomplete and C-shaped. 

Two or more of the cartilages often unite, partially or completely, and they are sometimes bifurcated at their extremities. 

The rings are generally highly elastic but they may calcify with age.

		
		


== Function ==

The trachea is one part of the respiratory tree that is a conduit for air to pass through on its way to or from the alveoli of the lungs. 

This transmits oxygen to the body and removes carbon dioxide.


== Use in killing humans ==

Crushing the trachea is a common tactic for temporarily or permanently disabling another human and is taught in the military, martial arts and police forces around the world.


== Clinical significance ==



=== Inflammation and infection ===

Inflammation of the trachea is known as tracheitis, usually due to an infection. 

It is usually caused by viral infections, with bacterial infections occurring almost entirely in children. 

Most commonly, infections occur with inflammation of other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, known as croup, however bacterial infections may also affect the trachea alone, although they are often associated with a recent viral infection. 

Viruses that cause croup are generally the parainfluenza viruses 1–3, with influenza viruses A and B also causing croup, but usually causing more serious infections; bacteria may also cause croup and include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. 

Causes of bacterial infection of the trachea are most commonly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. 

In patients who are in hospital, additional bacteria that may cause tracheitis include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.A person affected with tracheitis may start with symptoms that suggest an upper respiratory tract infection such as a cough, sore throat, or coryzal symptoms such as a runny nose. 

Fevers may develop and an affected child may develop difficulty breathing and sepsis. 

Swelling of the airway can cause narrowing of the airway, causing a hoarse breathing sound called stridor, or even cause complete blockage. 

Unfortunately, up to 80% of people affected by bacterial tracheitis require the use of mechanical ventilation, and treatment may include endoscopy for the purposes of acquiring microbiological specimens for culture and sensitivity, as well as removal of any dead tissue associated with the infection. 

Treatment in such situations usually includes antibiotics.


=== Narrowing ===


A trachea may be narrowed or compressed, usually a result of enlarged nearby lymph nodes; cancers of the trachea or nearby structures; large thyroid goitres; or rarely as a result of other processes such as unusually swollen blood vessels. 

Scarring from tracheobronchial injury or intubation; or inflammation associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis may also cause a narrowing of the trachea (tracheal stenosis). 

Obstruction invariably causes a harsh breathing sound known as stridor. 

A camera inserted via the mouth down into the trachea, called bronchoscopy, may be performed to investigate the cause of an obstruction. 

Management of obstructions depends on the cause. 

Obstructions as a result of malignancy may be managed with surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 

A stent may be inserted over the obstruction. 

Benign lesions, such as narrowing resulting from scarring, are likely to be surgically excised.One cause of narrowing is tracheomalacia, which is the tendency for the trachea to collapse when there is increased external pressure, such as when airflow is increased during breathing in or out, due to decreased compliance. 

It can be due to congenital causes, or due to things that develop after birth, such as compression from nearby masses or swelling, or trauma. 

Congenital tracheomalacia can occur by itself or in association with other abnormalities such as bronchomalacia or laryngomalacia, and abnormal connections between the trachea and the oesophagus, amongst others. 

Congenital tracheomalacia often improves without specific intervention; when required, interventions may include beta agonists and muscarinic agonists, which enhance the tone of the smooth muscle surrounding the trachea; positive pressure ventilation, or surgery, which may include the placement of a stent, or the removal of the affected part of the trachea. 

In dogs, particularly miniature dogs and toy dogs, tracheomalacia, as well as bronchomalacia, can lead to tracheal collapse, which often presents with a honking goose-like cough.


=== Intubation ===


Tracheal intubation refers to the insertion of a tube down the trachea. 

This procedure is commonly performed during surgery, in order to ensure a person receives enough oxygen when sedated. 

The catheter is connected to a machine that monitors the airflow, oxygenation and several other metrics. 

This is often one of the responsibilities of an anaesthetist during surgery.
In an emergency, or when tracheal intubation is deemed impossible, a tracheotomy is often performed to insert a tube for ventilation, usually when needed for particular types of surgery to be carried out so that the airway can be kept open. 

The provision of the opening via a tracheotomy is called a tracheostomy. 

Another method procedure can be carried, in an emergency situation, and this is a cricothyrotomy.


=== Congenital disorders ===


Tracheal agenesis is a rare birth defect in which the trachea fails to develop. 

The defect is usually fatal though sometimes surgical intervention has been successful.
A tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital defect in which the trachea and esophagus are abnormally connected (a fistula). 

This is because of abnormalities in the separation between the trachea and oesophagus during development. 

This occurs in approximately 1 in 3000 births, and the most common abnormalities is a separation of the upper and lower ends of the oesophagus, with the upper end finishing in a closed pouch. 

Other abnormalities may be associated with this, including cardiac abnormalities, or VACTERL syndrome. 

Such fistulas may be detected before a baby is born because of excess amniotic fluid; after birth, they are often associated with pneumonitis and pneumonia because of aspiration of food contents. 

Congenital fistulas are often treated by surgical repair. 

In adults, fistulas may occur because of erosion into the trachea from nearby malignant tumours, which erode into both the trachea and the oesophagus. 

Initially, these often result in coughing from swallowed contents of the oesophagus that are aspirated through the trachea, often progressing to fatal pneumonia; unfortunately, there is rarely a curative treatment. 

A tracheo-oesophageal puncture is a surgically created hole between the trachea and the esophagus in a person who has had their larynx removed. 

Air travels upwards from the surgical connection to the upper oesophagus and the pharynx, creating vibrations that create sound that can be used for speech. 

The purpose of the puncture is to restore a person's ability to speak after the vocal cords have been removed.Sometimes as an anatomical variation one or more of the tracheal rings are formed as complete rings, rather than horseshoe shaped rings. 

These O rings are smaller than the normal C-shaped rings and can cause narrowing (stenosis) of the trachea, resulting in breathing difficulties. 

An operation called a slide tracheoplasty can open up the rings and rejoin them as wider rings, shortening the length of the trachea. 

Slide tracheoplasty is said to be the best option in treating tracheal stenosis.Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of an abnormally enlarged trachea, characterised by absent elastic fibres, smooth muscle thinning, and a tendency to get recurrent respiratory tract infections.


=== Replacement ===

From 2008, operations have experimentally replaced tracheas, with those grown from stem cells, or with synthetic substitutes, however this is regarded as experimental and there is no standardised method. 

Difficulties with ensuring adequate blood supply to the replaced trachea is considered a major challenge to any replacement. 

Additionally, no evidence has been found to support the placement of stem cells taken from bone marrow on the trachea as a way of stimulating tissue regeneration, and such a method remains hypothetical.In January 2021, surgeons at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York performed the first complete trachea transplantation. 

The 18-hour procedure included harvesting a trachea from a donor and implanting it in the patient, connecting numerous veins and arteries to provide sufficient blood flow to the organ.


== Other animals ==

Allowing for variations in the length of the neck, the trachea in other mammals is, in general, similar to that in humans. 

Generally, it is also similar to the reptilian trachea.


=== Vertebrates ===

In birds, the trachea runs from the pharynx to the syrinx, from which the primary bronchi diverge. 

Swans have an unusually elongated trachea, part of which is coiled beneath the sternum; this may act as a resonator to amplify sound. 

In some birds, the tracheal rings are complete, and may even be ossified.In amphibians, the trachea is normally extremely short, and leads directly into the lungs, without clear primary bronchi. 

A longer trachea is, however, found in some long-necked salamanders, and in caecilians. 

While there are irregular cartilagenous nodules on the amphibian trachea, these do not form the rings found in amniotes.The only vertebrates to have lungs, but no trachea, are the lungfish and the Polypterus, in which the lungs arise directly from the pharynx.


=== Invertebrates ===


The word trachea is used to define a very different organ in invertebrates than in vertebrates. 

Insects have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues. 

The distribution of spiracles can vary greatly among the many orders of insects, but in general each segment of the body can have only one pair of spiracles, each of which connects to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. 

The tracheae are invaginations of the cuticular exoskeleton that branch (anastomose) throughout the body with diameters from only a few micrometres up to 0.8 mm. 

Diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place across the walls of the smallest tubes, called tracheoles, which penetrate tissues and even indent individual cells. 

Gas may be conducted through the respiratory system by means of active ventilation or passive diffusion. 

Unlike vertebrates, insects do not generally carry oxygen in their haemolymph.
This is one of the factors that may limit their size.
A tracheal tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia in various geometries such as loops or helices. 

Taenidia provide strength and flexibility to the trachea. 

In the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae may also be connected to air sacs. 

Many insects, such as grasshoppers and bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are able to control the flow of air through their body. 

In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, in the form of a gill, or function essentially as normal, via a plastron. 

Note that despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are lined with cuticular tissue and are shed during moulting (ecdysis).

TRÁQUEA


La tráquea, también conocida como tráquea, es un tubo cartilaginoso que conecta la laringe con los bronquios de los pulmones, permitiendo el paso del aire, por lo que está presente en casi todos los animales con pulmones que respiran aire. 

La tráquea se extiende desde la laringe y se ramifica en los dos bronquios primarios. 

En la parte superior de la tráquea, el cartílago cricoides la une a la laringe. 

La tráquea está formada por una serie de anillos en forma de herradura, unidos verticalmente por ligamentos superpuestos y por el músculo traqueal en sus extremos. 

La epiglotis cierra la abertura de la laringe durante la deglución.
La tráquea comienza a formarse en el segundo mes de desarrollo del embrión, haciéndose más larga y más fija en su posición con el tiempo. 

Es un epitelio revestido con células en forma de columna que tienen extensiones similares a cabellos llamadas cilios, con células caliciformes dispersas que producen mucinas protectoras. 

La tráquea puede verse afectada por inflamación o infección, generalmente como resultado de una enfermedad viral que afecta a otras partes del tracto respiratorio, como la laringe y los bronquios, llamada crup, que puede provocar tos perruna.

La infección con bacterias generalmente afecta solo la tráquea y puede causar estrechamiento o incluso obstrucción.

Como una parte importante del tracto respiratorio, cuando la tráquea está obstruida evita que el aire ingrese a los pulmones y, por lo tanto, puede ser necesaria una traqueotomía si la tráquea está obstruida.

Además, durante la cirugía, si se requiere ventilación mecánica cuando una persona está sedada, se inserta un tubo en la tráquea, lo que se denomina intubación.

La palabra tráquea se usa para definir un órgano muy diferente en los invertebrados que en los vertebrados.

Los insectos tienen un sistema respiratorio abierto formado por espiráculos, tráqueas y traqueolas para transportar gases metabólicos hacia y desde los tejidos.


== Estructura ==


La tráquea de un adulto tiene un diámetro interior de aproximadamente 1,5 a 2 centímetros (0,59 a 0,79 pulgadas) y una longitud de aproximadamente 10 a 11 centímetros (3,9 a 4,3 pulgadas); más ancha en los machos que en las hembras.

Comienza en la parte inferior de la laringe y termina en la carina, el punto donde la tráquea se ramifica en los bronquios principales izquierdo y derecho.

La tráquea está rodeada por 16 a 20 anillos de cartílago hialino; estos 'anillos' tienen 4 milímetros de altura en el adulto, incompletos y en forma de C.

Los ligamentos conectan los anillos.

El músculo traqueal conecta los extremos de los anillos incompletos y corre a lo largo de la pared posterior de la tráquea.

Además, la adventicia, que es la capa más externa de tejido conectivo que rodea el cartílago hialino, contribuye a la capacidad de la tráquea para doblarse y estirarse con el movimiento.

La tráquea comienza en el borde inferior del cartílago cricoides de la laringe y termina en la carina, el punto donde la tráquea se ramifica en los bronquios principales izquierdo y derecho.

La tráquea comienza a la altura de la sexta vértebra cervical (C6), y la carina se encuentra a la altura de la cuarta vértebra torácica (T4), aunque su posición puede cambiar con la respiración.


=== Estructuras cercanas ===

La tráquea pasa por muchas estructuras del cuello y el tórax (tórax) a lo largo de su curso.
Delante de la tráquea superior se encuentra el tejido conectivo y la piel.

Varias otras estructuras pasan por encima o se asientan sobre la tráquea; el arco yugular, que une las dos venas yugulares anteriores, se asienta frente a la parte superior de la tráquea.

Los músculos esternohioideo y esternotiroideo se extienden a lo largo de su longitud. 

La glándula tiroides también se extiende a lo largo de la tráquea superior, con el istmo cubriendo los anillos segundo a cuarto, y los lóbulos se extienden hasta el nivel del quinto o sexto cartílago. 

Los vasos sanguíneos de la tiroides descansan sobre la tráquea junto al istmo; las arterias tiroideas superiores se unen justo por encima y las venas tiroideas inferiores por debajo.

Frente a la tráquea inferior se encuentra el manubrio del esternón, los restos del timo en los adultos. 

Al frente izquierdo se encuentran los grandes vasos sanguíneos del arco aórtico y sus ramas, la arteria carótida común izquierda y el tronco braquiocefálico; y la vena braquiocefálica izquierda.

El plexo cardíaco profundo y los ganglios linfáticos también se ubican frente a la tráquea inferior. Detrás de la tráquea, a lo largo de su longitud, se encuentra el esófago, seguido por el tejido conectivo y la columna vertebral. 

A sus lados corren las arterias carótidas y las arterias tiroideas inferiores; ya sus lados, en su superficie posterior, corren los nervios laríngeos recurrentes en la tráquea superior y los nervios vagos en la tráquea inferior.

El músculo traqueal se contrae durante la tos, reduciendo el tamaño de la luz de la tráquea.

 


=== Abastecimiento sanguíneo y linfático ===


La parte superior de la tráquea recibe y drena sangre a través de las arterias y venas tiroideas inferiores; la tráquea inferior recibe sangre de las arterias bronquiales.

Las arterias que irrigan la tráquea lo hacen a través de pequeñas ramas que irrigan la tráquea desde los lados. 

A medida que las ramas se acercan a la pared de la tráquea, se dividen en ramas inferior y superior, que se unen con las ramas de las arterias por encima y por debajo; estos luego se dividen en ramas que irrigan las partes anterior y posterior de la tráquea.

Las arterias tiroideas inferiores nacen justo debajo del istmo de la tiroides, que se asienta sobre la tráquea. 

Estas arterias se unen (anastomosis) con ramas ascendentes de las arterias bronquiales, que son ramas directas de la aorta, para suministrar sangre a la tráquea. 

Los vasos linfáticos de la tráquea drenan en los ganglios pretraqueales que se encuentran frente a la tráquea y en los ganglios linfáticos paratraqueales que se encuentran a su lado.


=== Desarrollo ===

En la cuarta semana de desarrollo del embrión humano, a medida que crece el brote respiratorio, la tráquea se separa del intestino anterior mediante la formación de crestas que eventualmente separan la tráquea del esófago, el tabique traqueoesofágico. 

Esto separa la futura tráquea del esófago y divide el tubo del intestino anterior en el tubo laringotraqueal. 

Al comienzo de la quinta semana, los bronquios principales izquierdo y derecho han comenzado a formarse, inicialmente como yemas en el extremo terminal de la tráquea. La tráquea no tiene más de 4 mm de diámetro durante el primer año de vida, expandiéndose hasta su diámetro adulto. de aproximadamente 2 cm al final de la infancia. 

La tráquea es más circular y más vertical en los niños en comparación con los adultos, varía más en tamaño y también varía más en su posición en relación con las estructuras circundantes.


=== Microanatomía ===

La tráquea está revestida con una capa de capas intercaladas de células en forma de columna con cilios. 

El epitelio contiene células caliciformes, que son células glandulares en forma de columna que producen mucinas, el principal componente de la mucosidad. 

La mucosidad ayuda a humedecer y proteger las vías respiratorias. 

El moco recubre las células ciliadas de la tráquea para atrapar partículas extrañas inhaladas que los cilios luego transportan hacia la laringe y luego la faringe, donde pueden tragarse en el estómago o expulsarse como flema. 

Este mecanismo de autodepuración se denomina depuración mucociliar. La tráquea está rodeada por 16 a 20 anillos de cartílago hialino; estos 'anillos' están incompletos y tienen forma de C.

Dos o más de los cartílagos a menudo se unen, parcial o completamente, ya veces se bifurcan en sus extremos.

Los anillos son generalmente muy elásticos pero pueden calcificarse con la edad.

 
 


== Función ==

La tráquea es una parte del árbol respiratorio que es un conducto por el que pasa el aire en su camino hacia o desde los alvéolos de los pulmones.

Esto transmite oxígeno al cuerpo y elimina el dióxido de carbono.


== Uso para matar humanos ==

Aplastar la tráquea es una táctica común para incapacitar temporal o permanentemente a otro ser humano y se enseña en las fuerzas militares, de artes marciales y policiales de todo el mundo.


== Importancia clínica ==



=== Inflamación e infección ===

La inflamación de la tráquea se conoce como traqueítis, generalmente debido a una infección.

Por lo general, es causada por infecciones virales, y las infecciones bacterianas ocurren casi en su totalidad en niños.

Más comúnmente, las infecciones ocurren con la inflamación de otras partes del tracto respiratorio, como la laringe y los bronquios, lo que se conoce como crup; sin embargo, las infecciones bacterianas también pueden afectar solo a la tráquea, aunque a menudo se asocian con una infección viral reciente. 

Los virus que causan el crup son generalmente los virus de la parainfluenza 1–3, y los virus de la influenza A y B también causan el crup, pero por lo general provocan infecciones más graves; Las bacterias también pueden causar crup e incluyen Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae y Moraxella catarrhalis.

Las causas de infección bacteriana de la tráquea son más comúnmente Staphylococcus aureus y Streptococcus pneumoniae. 

En pacientes hospitalizados, otras bacterias que pueden causar traqueítis incluyen Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae y Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Una persona afectada con traqueítis puede comenzar con síntomas que sugieran una infección del tracto respiratorio superior, como tos, dolor de garganta o coriza. síntomas como secreción nasal.

Se pueden desarrollar fiebres y un niño afectado puede desarrollar dificultad para respirar y sepsis.

La inflamación de las vías respiratorias puede causar un estrechamiento de las vías respiratorias, provocando un sonido respiratorio ronco llamado estridor, o incluso causar un bloqueo completo.

Desafortunadamente, hasta el 80 % de las personas afectadas por traqueítis bacteriana requieren el uso de ventilación mecánica, y el tratamiento puede incluir una endoscopia con el fin de adquirir muestras microbiológicas para cultivo y sensibilidad, así como la extracción de cualquier tejido muerto asociado con la infección. 

El tratamiento en tales situaciones generalmente incluye antibióticos.


=== Estrechamiento ===


Una tráquea puede estrecharse o comprimirse, generalmente como resultado del agrandamiento de los ganglios linfáticos cercanos; cánceres de la tráquea o estructuras cercanas; grandes bocios de tiroides; o rara vez como resultado de otros procesos, como vasos sanguíneos inusualmente hinchados.

Cicatrización por lesión traqueobronquial o intubación; o la inflamación asociada con la granulomatosis con poliangeítis también puede causar un estrechamiento de la tráquea (estenosis traqueal).

La obstrucción provoca invariablemente un sonido respiratorio áspero conocido como estridor. 

Se puede realizar una cámara insertada a través de la boca hacia la tráquea, llamada broncoscopia, para investigar la causa de una obstrucción. 

El manejo de las obstrucciones depende de la causa. 

Las obstrucciones como resultado de una neoplasia maligna pueden tratarse con cirugía, quimioterapia o radioterapia. 

Se puede insertar un stent sobre la obstrucción. 

Es probable que las lesiones benignas, como el estrechamiento resultante de la cicatrización, se extirpen quirúrgicamente. Una causa del estrechamiento es la traqueomalacia, que es la tendencia de la tráquea a colapsarse cuando aumenta la presión externa, como cuando aumenta el flujo de aire durante la inspiración o hacia fuera, debido a la disminución del cumplimiento. 

Puede deberse a causas congénitas o a cosas que se desarrollan después del nacimiento, como la compresión de masas cercanas, hinchazón o trauma. 

La traqueomalacia congénita puede ocurrir sola o asociada a otras anomalías como broncomalacia o laringomalacia, y conexiones anormales entre la tráquea y el esófago, entre otras. 

La traqueomalacia congénita a menudo mejora sin una intervención específica; cuando sea necesario, las intervenciones pueden incluir agonistas beta y agonistas muscarínicos, que mejoran el tono del músculo liso que rodea la tráquea; ventilación con presión positiva o cirugía, que puede incluir la colocación de un stent o la extracción de la parte afectada de la tráquea.

En los perros, en particular los perros miniatura y los perros de juguete, la traqueomalacia, así como la broncomalacia, pueden provocar un colapso traqueal, que a menudo se presenta con una tos parecida a la de un ganso.


=== Intubación ===


La intubación traqueal se refiere a la inserción de un tubo por la tráquea. 

Este procedimiento se realiza comúnmente durante la cirugía, para garantizar que una persona reciba suficiente oxígeno cuando esté sedado. 

El catéter está conectado a una máquina que monitorea el flujo de aire, la oxigenación y varias otras métricas. 

Esta es a menudo una de las responsabilidades de un anestesista durante la cirugía.
En una emergencia, o cuando la intubación traqueal se considera imposible, a menudo se realiza una traqueotomía para insertar un tubo de ventilación, generalmente cuando es necesario para realizar tipos particulares de cirugía a fin de mantener abiertas las vías respiratorias. 

La provisión de la abertura a través de una traqueotomía se denomina traqueotomía. 

Se puede llevar a cabo otro método de procedimiento, en una situación de emergencia, y este es una cricotiroidotomía.


=== Trastornos congénitos ===


La agenesia traqueal es un defecto congénito raro en el que la tráquea no se desarrolla. 

El defecto suele ser fatal, aunque a veces la intervención quirúrgica ha tenido éxito.
Una fístula traqueoesofágica es un defecto congénito en el que la tráquea y el esófago están conectados de manera anormal (una fístula). 

Esto se debe a anomalías en la separación entre la tráquea y el esófago durante el desarrollo. 

Esto ocurre en aproximadamente 1 de cada 3000 nacimientos, y la anomalía más común es la separación de los extremos superior e inferior del esófago, con el extremo superior terminando en una bolsa cerrada. 

Otras anomalías pueden estar asociadas con esto, incluidas anomalías cardíacas o el síndrome VACTERL.

Tales fístulas pueden detectarse antes de que nazca un bebé debido al exceso de líquido amniótico; después del nacimiento, a menudo se asocian con neumonitis y neumonía debido a la aspiración del contenido de los alimentos.

Las fístulas congénitas a menudo se tratan mediante reparación quirúrgica.

En adultos, las fístulas pueden ocurrir debido a la erosión en la tráquea de tumores malignos cercanos, que erosionan tanto la tráquea como el esófago.

Inicialmente, estos a menudo provocan tos por el contenido tragado del esófago que se aspira a través de la tráquea, lo que a menudo progresa hasta una neumonía fatal; desafortunadamente, rara vez existe un tratamiento curativo.

Una punción traqueoesofágica es un orificio creado quirúrgicamente entre la tráquea y el esófago en una persona a la que se le ha extirpado la laringe.

El aire viaja hacia arriba desde la conexión quirúrgica hasta la parte superior del esófago y la faringe, creando vibraciones que crean un sonido que puede usarse para hablar.

El propósito de la punción es restaurar la capacidad de hablar de una persona después de que se hayan extraído las cuerdas vocales. A veces, como una variación anatómica, uno o más de los anillos traqueales se forman como anillos completos, en lugar de anillos en forma de herradura.

Estos anillos en O son más pequeños que los anillos en forma de C normales y pueden causar un estrechamiento (estenosis) de la tráquea, lo que resulta en dificultades para respirar.

Una operación llamada traqueoplastia de deslizamiento puede abrir los anillos y volver a unirlos como anillos más anchos, acortando la longitud de la tráquea.

Se dice que la traqueoplastia deslizante es la mejor opción para tratar la estenosis traqueal. El síndrome de Mounier-Kuhn es un trastorno congénito raro de una tráquea anormalmente agrandada, caracterizada por la ausencia de fibras elásticas, adelgazamiento del músculo liso y una tendencia a contraer infecciones recurrentes del tracto respiratorio.


=== Reemplazo ===

Desde 2008, las operaciones han reemplazado experimentalmente las tráqueas, con aquellas cultivadas a partir de células madre o con sustitutos sintéticos, sin embargo, esto se considera experimental y no existe un método estandarizado.

Las dificultades para garantizar un suministro de sangre adecuado a la tráquea reemplazada se consideran un desafío importante para cualquier reemplazo.

Además, no se ha encontrado evidencia que respalde la colocación de células madre extraídas de la médula ósea en la tráquea como una forma de estimular la regeneración de tejidos, y dicho método sigue siendo hipotético. En enero de 2021, los cirujanos del Hospital Mount Sinai en Nueva York realizaron la primer trasplante completo de tráquea.

El procedimiento de 18 horas incluyó extraer una tráquea de un donante e implantarla en el paciente, conectando numerosas venas y arterias para proporcionar suficiente flujo de sangre al órgano.

Teniendo en cuenta las variaciones en la longitud del cuello, la tráquea de otros mamíferos es, en general, similar a la de los humanos.

En general, también es similar a la tráquea de los reptiles.


=== Vertebrados ===

En las aves, la tráquea se extiende desde la faringe hasta la siringe, de donde se separan los bronquios primarios.

Los cisnes tienen una tráquea inusualmente alargada, parte de la cual está enrollada debajo del esternón; esto puede actuar como un resonador para amplificar el sonido.

En algunas aves, los anillos traqueales están completos e incluso pueden estar osificados. En los anfibios, la tráquea normalmente es extremadamente corta y conduce directamente a los pulmones, sin bronquios primarios claros.

Sin embargo, se encuentra una tráquea más larga en algunas salamandras de cuello largo y en las cecilias.

Si bien hay nódulos cartilaginosos irregulares en la tráquea de los anfibios, estos no forman los anillos que se encuentran en los amniotas. Los únicos vertebrados que tienen pulmones, pero no tráquea, son el pez pulmonado y el Polypterus, en el que los pulmones surgen directamente de la faringe.


=== Invertebrados ===


La palabra tráquea se usa para definir un órgano muy diferente en los invertebrados que en los vertebrados.

Los insectos tienen un sistema respiratorio abierto formado por espiráculos, tráqueas y traqueolas para transportar gases metabólicos hacia y desde los tejidos.

La distribución de los espiráculos puede variar mucho entre los muchos órdenes de insectos, pero en general cada segmento del cuerpo puede tener solo un par de espiráculos, cada uno de los cuales se conecta a un atrio y tiene un tubo traqueal relativamente grande detrás.

Las tráqueas son invaginaciones del exoesqueleto cuticular que se ramifican (anastomosan) por todo el cuerpo con diámetros que van desde unas pocas micras hasta 0,8 mm.

La difusión de oxígeno y dióxido de carbono tiene lugar a través de las paredes de los tubos más pequeños, llamados traqueolas, que penetran en los tejidos e incluso indentan células individuales.

El gas puede ser conducido a través del sistema respiratorio por medio de ventilación activa o difusión pasiva.

A diferencia de los vertebrados, los insectos generalmente no transportan oxígeno en su hemolinfa.
Este es uno de los factores que pueden limitar su tamaño.
Un tubo traqueal puede contener anillos circunferenciales de taenidia en forma de cresta en varias geometrías, como bucles o hélices.

Taenidia proporciona fuerza y ​​flexibilidad a la tráquea.

En la cabeza, el tórax o el abdomen, las tráqueas también pueden estar conectadas a sacos de aire.

Muchos insectos, como los saltamontes y las abejas, que bombean activamente los sacos de aire de su abdomen, pueden controlar el flujo de aire a través de su cuerpo.

En algunos insectos acuáticos, las tráqueas intercambian gas a través de la pared del cuerpo directamente, en forma de branquias, o funcionan esencialmente de manera normal, a través de un plastrón.

Tenga en cuenta que, a pesar de ser internas, las tráqueas de los artrópodos están revestidas con tejido cuticular y se desprenden durante la muda (ecdisis).

TRACHÉE


La trachée, également connue sous le nom de trachée, est un tube cartilagineux qui relie le larynx aux bronches des poumons, permettant le passage de l'air, et est donc présent chez presque tous les animaux à respiration aérienne avec des poumons. 

La trachée s'étend du larynx et se ramifie dans les deux bronches primaires.

Au sommet de la trachée, le cartilage cricoïde l'attache au larynx.

La trachée est formée d'un certain nombre d'anneaux en forme de fer à cheval, reliés verticalement par des ligaments superposés et par le muscle trachéal à leurs extrémités.

L'épiglotte ferme l'ouverture du larynx lors de la déglutition.
La trachée commence à se former au cours du deuxième mois de développement de l'embryon, devenant plus longue et plus fixe dans sa position au fil du temps.

C'est un épithélium tapissé de cellules en forme de colonne qui ont des extensions ressemblant à des cheveux appelées cils, avec des cellules caliciformes dispersées qui produisent des mucines protectrices.

La trachée peut être affectée par une inflammation ou une infection, généralement à la suite d'une maladie virale affectant d'autres parties des voies respiratoires, telles que le larynx et les bronches, appelées croup, pouvant entraîner une toux aboyante. 

L'infection par des bactéries n'affecte généralement que la trachée et peut provoquer un rétrécissement ou même une obstruction. 

En tant que partie majeure des voies respiratoires, lorsqu'elle est obstruée, la trachée empêche l'air d'entrer dans les poumons et une trachéotomie peut donc être nécessaire si la trachée est obstruée. 

De plus, pendant la chirurgie, si une ventilation mécanique est nécessaire lorsqu'une personne est sous sédation, un tube est inséré dans la trachée, appelée intubation.

Le mot trachée est utilisé pour définir un organe très différent chez les invertébrés que chez les vertébrés. 

Les insectes ont un système respiratoire ouvert composé de stigmates, de trachées et de trachéoles pour transporter les gaz métaboliques vers et depuis les tissus.


== Structure ==


La trachée d'un adulte a un diamètre intérieur d'environ 1,5 à 2 centimètres (0,59 à 0,79 pouces) et une longueur d'environ 10 à 11 centimètres (3,9 à 4,3 pouces); plus large chez les mâles que chez les femelles.

Il commence au bas du larynx et se termine à la carène, le point où la trachée se ramifie dans les bronches principales gauche et droite. 

La trachée est entourée de 16 à 20 anneaux de cartilage hyalin ; ces « anneaux » mesurent 4 millimètres de haut chez l'adulte, sont incomplets et en forme de C.

Les ligaments relient les anneaux. 

Le muscle trachéal relie les extrémités des anneaux incomplets et longe la paroi arrière de la trachée. 

De plus, l'adventice, qui est la couche la plus externe du tissu conjonctif qui entoure le cartilage hyalin, contribue à la capacité de la trachée à se plier et à s'étirer avec le mouvement.

La trachée commence au bord inférieur du cartilage cricoïde du larynx et se termine à la carène, le point où la trachée se ramifie en bronches principales gauche et droite. 

La trachée commence au niveau de la sixième vertèbre cervicale (C6) et la carène se trouve au niveau de la quatrième vertèbre thoracique (T4), bien que sa position puisse changer avec la respiration.


=== Structures à proximité ===

La trachée passe par de nombreuses structures du cou et de la poitrine (thorax) le long de son parcours.
Devant la trachée supérieure se trouvent le tissu conjonctif et la peau. 

Plusieurs autres structures passent ou reposent sur la trachée ; l'arc jugulaire, qui relie les deux veines jugulaires antérieures, siège devant la partie supérieure de la trachée.

Les muscles sternohyoïdien et sternothyroïdien s'étirent sur toute sa longueur. 

La glande thyroïde s'étend également à travers la trachée supérieure, l'isthme recouvrant les deuxième à quatrième anneaux et les lobes s'étendant jusqu'au niveau du cinquième ou du sixième cartilage. 

Les vaisseaux sanguins de la thyroïde reposent sur la trachée à côté de l'isthme ; les artères thyroïdiennes supérieures se rejoignent juste au-dessus et les veines thyroïdiennes inférieures en dessous.

Devant la trachée inférieure se trouve le manubrium du sternum, les restes du thymus chez l'adulte. 

À l'avant gauche se trouvent les gros vaisseaux sanguins l'arc aortique et ses branches l'artère carotide commune gauche et le tronc brachiocéphalique ; et la veine brachiocéphalique gauche.

Le plexus cardiaque profond et les ganglions lymphatiques sont également positionnés devant la trachée inférieure. Derrière la trachée, sur toute sa longueur, se trouve l'œsophage, suivi du tissu conjonctif et de la colonne vertébrale. 

À ses côtés courent les artères carotides et les artères thyroïdiennes inférieures ; et sur ses côtés, sur sa surface arrière, courent les nerfs laryngés récurrents dans la trachée supérieure et les nerfs vagues dans la trachée inférieure.

Le muscle trachéal se contracte pendant la toux, réduisant la taille de la lumière de la trachée.

 


=== Apport sanguin et lymphatique ===


La partie supérieure de la trachée reçoit et draine le sang par les artères et les veines thyroïdiennes inférieures ; la trachée inférieure reçoit le sang des artères bronchiques.

Les artères qui alimentent la trachée le font via de petites branches qui alimentent la trachée par les côtés. 

Au fur et à mesure que les branches s'approchent de la paroi de la trachée, elles se divisent en branches inférieures et supérieures, qui se rejoignent avec les branches des artères au-dessus et au-dessous; ceux-ci se divisent ensuite en branches qui alimentent les parties antérieure et postérieure de la trachée.

Les artères thyroïdiennes inférieures apparaissent juste en dessous de l'isthme de la thyroïde, qui se trouve au sommet de la trachée. 

Ces artères se rejoignent (anastamoses) avec les branches ascendantes des artères bronchiques, qui sont des branches directes de l'aorte, pour irriguer la trachée. 

Les vaisseaux lymphatiques de la trachée se drainent dans les ganglions prétrachéaux qui se trouvent devant la trachée et les ganglions lymphatiques paratrachéaux qui se trouvent à côté.


=== Développement ===

Au cours de la quatrième semaine de développement de l'embryon humain à mesure que le bourgeon respiratoire se développe, la trachée se sépare de l'intestin antérieur par la formation de crêtes qui séparent finalement la trachée de l'œsophage, le septum trachéo-œsophagien. 

Cela sépare la future trachée de l'œsophage et divise le tube de l'intestin antérieur en tube laryngotrachéal. 

Au début de la cinquième semaine, les bronches principales gauche et droite ont commencé à se former, initialement sous forme de bourgeons à l'extrémité terminale de la trachée. La trachée ne mesure pas plus de 4 mm de diamètre au cours de la première année de vie, s'étendant jusqu'à son diamètre adulte. d'environ 2 cm à la fin de l'enfance. 

La trachée est plus circulaire et plus verticale chez les enfants que chez les adultes, varie plus en taille et varie également plus dans sa position par rapport à ses structures environnantes.


=== Microanatomie ===

La trachée est tapissée d'une couche de couches intercalées de cellules en forme de colonne avec des cils.

L'épithélium contient des cellules caliciformes, qui sont des cellules glandulaires en forme de colonne qui produisent des mucines, le principal composant du mucus.

Le mucus aide à humidifier et à protéger les voies respiratoires.

Le mucus tapisse les cellules ciliées de la trachée pour piéger les particules étrangères inhalées que les cils soulèvent ensuite vers le larynx puis le pharynx où ils peuvent être soit avalés dans l'estomac, soit expulsés sous forme de mucosités.

Ce mécanisme d'auto-nettoyage est appelé clairance mucociliaire. La trachée est entourée de 16 à 20 anneaux de cartilage hyalin ; ces « anneaux » sont incomplets et en forme de C.

Deux ou plusieurs des cartilages s'unissent souvent, partiellement ou complètement, et ils sont parfois bifurqués à leurs extrémités. 

Les anneaux sont généralement très élastiques mais ils peuvent se calcifier avec l'âge.

 
 


== Fonction ==

La trachée est une partie de l'arbre respiratoire qui est un conduit par lequel l'air passe sur son chemin vers ou depuis les alvéoles des poumons. 

Cela transmet l'oxygène au corps et élimine le dioxyde de carbone.


== Utiliser pour tuer des humains ==

L'écrasement de la trachée est une tactique courante pour désactiver temporairement ou définitivement un autre être humain et est enseignée dans l'armée, les arts martiaux et les forces de police du monde entier.


== Signification clinique ==



=== Inflammation et infection ===

L'inflammation de la trachée est connue sous le nom de trachéite, généralement due à une infection.

Elle est généralement causée par des infections virales, les infections bactériennes survenant presque entièrement chez les enfants.

Le plus souvent, les infections surviennent avec une inflammation d'autres parties des voies respiratoires, telles que le larynx et les bronches, appelées croup, mais les infections bactériennes peuvent également affecter la trachée seule, bien qu'elles soient souvent associées à une infection virale récente.

Les virus qui causent le croup sont généralement les virus parainfluenza 1 à 3, les virus grippaux A et B causant également le croup, mais causant généralement des infections plus graves; les bactéries peuvent également causer le croup et comprennent Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae et Moraxella catarrhalis.

Les causes d'infection bactérienne de la trachée sont le plus souvent Staphylococcus aureus et Streptococcus pneumoniae. 

Chez les patients hospitalisés, d'autres bactéries susceptibles de provoquer une trachéite comprennent Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae et Pseudomonas aeruginosa. symptômes tels que le nez qui coule. 

Des fièvres peuvent se développer et un enfant affecté peut développer des difficultés respiratoires et une septicémie. 

Le gonflement des voies respiratoires peut provoquer un rétrécissement des voies respiratoires, provoquant un bruit de respiration rauque appelé stridor, ou même provoquer un blocage complet. 

Malheureusement, jusqu'à 80 % des personnes atteintes de trachéite bactérienne nécessitent l'utilisation d'une ventilation mécanique, et le traitement peut inclure une endoscopie dans le but d'acquérir des échantillons microbiologiques pour la culture et la sensibilité, ainsi que l'élimination de tout tissu mort associé à l'infection.

Le traitement dans de telles situations comprend généralement des antibiotiques.


=== Rétrécissement ===


Une trachée peut être rétrécie ou comprimée, généralement à la suite d'une hypertrophie des ganglions lymphatiques voisins; cancers de la trachée ou des structures voisines ; gros goitres thyroïdiens; ou rarement à la suite d'autres processus tels que des vaisseaux sanguins anormalement gonflés.

Cicatrices d'une blessure trachéobronchique ou d'une intubation ; ou une inflammation associée à une granulomatose avec polyangéite peut également provoquer un rétrécissement de la trachée (sténose trachéale).

L'obstruction provoque invariablement un bruit de respiration rauque appelé stridor. 

Une caméra insérée par la bouche dans la trachée, appelée bronchoscopie, peut être effectuée pour rechercher la cause d'une obstruction. 

La gestion des obstructions dépend de la cause. 

Les obstructions résultant d'une malignité peuvent être gérées par chirurgie, chimiothérapie ou radiothérapie. 

Un stent peut être inséré sur l'obstruction. 

Les lésions bénignes, telles que le rétrécissement résultant de la cicatrisation, sont susceptibles d'être excisées chirurgicalement. L'une des causes du rétrécissement est la trachéomalacie, qui est la tendance de la trachée à s'effondrer en cas d'augmentation de la pression externe, par exemple lorsque le débit d'air augmente pendant l'inspiration ou la respiration. en raison d'une diminution de la conformité. 

Cela peut être dû à des causes congénitales, ou à des choses qui se développent après la naissance, comme la compression de masses voisines ou un gonflement, ou un traumatisme.

La trachéomalacie congénitale peut survenir seule ou en association avec d'autres anomalies telles que la bronchomalacie ou la laryngomalacie, et des connexions anormales entre la trachée et l'œsophage, entre autres.

La trachéomalacie congénitale s'améliore souvent sans intervention spécifique; si nécessaire, les interventions peuvent inclure des bêta-agonistes et des agonistes muscariniques, qui améliorent le tonus du muscle lisse entourant la trachée ; une ventilation à pression positive ou une intervention chirurgicale pouvant inclure la mise en place d'un stent ou l'ablation de la partie affectée de la trachée.

Chez les chiens, en particulier les chiens miniatures et les chiens jouets, la trachéomalacie, ainsi que la bronchomalacie, peuvent entraîner un collapsus trachéal, qui se manifeste souvent par une toux ressemblant à une oie.


=== Intubation ===


L'intubation trachéale fait référence à l'insertion d'un tube dans la trachée. 

Cette procédure est couramment effectuée pendant la chirurgie, afin de s'assurer qu'une personne reçoit suffisamment d'oxygène lorsqu'elle est sous sédation. 

Le cathéter est relié à une machine qui surveille le débit d'air, l'oxygénation et plusieurs autres mesures. 

C'est souvent l'une des responsabilités d'un anesthésiste pendant la chirurgie.
En cas d'urgence, ou lorsque l'intubation trachéale est jugée impossible, une trachéotomie est souvent pratiquée pour insérer un tube de ventilation, généralement lorsque cela est nécessaire pour des types particuliers de chirurgie à effectuer afin que les voies respiratoires puissent être maintenues ouvertes. 

La fourniture de l'ouverture via une trachéotomie s'appelle une trachéotomie. 

Une autre procédure de méthode peut être effectuée, dans une situation d'urgence, et c'est une cricothyrotomie.


=== Affections congénitales ===


L'agénésie trachéale est une anomalie congénitale rare dans laquelle la trachée ne se développe pas. 

Le défaut est généralement mortel, bien que parfois une intervention chirurgicale ait réussi.
Une fistule trachéo-œsophagienne est une anomalie congénitale dans laquelle la trachée et l'œsophage sont anormalement connectés (une fistule). 

Cela est dû à des anomalies dans la séparation entre la trachée et l'œsophage au cours du développement. 

Cela se produit dans environ 1 naissance sur 3000, et les anomalies les plus courantes sont une séparation des extrémités supérieure et inférieure de l'œsophage, l'extrémité supérieure se terminant dans une poche fermée. 

D'autres anomalies peuvent y être associées, notamment des anomalies cardiaques ou le syndrome VACTERL.

De telles fistules peuvent être détectées avant la naissance d'un bébé en raison d'un excès de liquide amniotique ; après la naissance, ils sont souvent associés à une pneumonite et à une pneumonie en raison de l'aspiration du contenu des aliments.

Les fistules congénitales sont souvent traitées par réparation chirurgicale.

Chez les adultes, des fistules peuvent survenir en raison de l'érosion de la trachée par des tumeurs malignes voisines, qui érodent à la fois la trachée et l'œsophage.

Initialement, ceux-ci entraînent souvent une toux du contenu avalé de l'œsophage qui est aspiré par la trachée, évoluant souvent vers une pneumonie mortelle; malheureusement, il existe rarement un traitement curatif.

Une ponction trachéo-œsophagienne est un trou créé chirurgicalement entre la trachée et l'œsophage chez une personne dont le larynx a été retiré. 

L'air monte de la connexion chirurgicale à l'œsophage supérieur et au pharynx, créant des vibrations qui créent un son qui peut être utilisé pour la parole. 

Le but de la ponction est de restaurer la capacité d'une personne à parler après le retrait des cordes vocales. Parfois, en tant que variation anatomique, un ou plusieurs des anneaux trachéaux sont formés comme des anneaux complets, plutôt que comme des anneaux en forme de fer à cheval. 

Ces joints toriques sont plus petits que les anneaux normaux en forme de C et peuvent provoquer un rétrécissement (sténose) de la trachée, entraînant des difficultés respiratoires. 

Une opération appelée trachéoplastie par glissement peut ouvrir les anneaux et les rejoindre en anneaux plus larges, raccourcissant la longueur de la trachée. 

On dit que la trachéoplastie par glissement est la meilleure option dans le traitement de la sténose trachéale. Le syndrome de Mounier-Kuhn est une maladie congénitale rare d'une trachée anormalement élargie, caractérisée par des fibres élastiques absentes, un amincissement des muscles lisses et une tendance à contracter des infections récurrentes des voies respiratoires.


=== Remplacement ===

À partir de 2008, des opérations ont remplacé expérimentalement les trachées, par celles issues de cellules souches ou par des substituts synthétiques, mais cela est considéré comme expérimental et il n'existe pas de méthode standardisée.

Les difficultés à assurer un apport sanguin adéquat à la trachée remplacée sont considérées comme un défi majeur pour tout remplacement.

De plus, aucune preuve n'a été trouvée pour soutenir le placement de cellules souches prélevées de la moelle osseuse sur la trachée comme moyen de stimuler la régénération tissulaire, et une telle méthode reste hypothétique. En janvier 2021, des chirurgiens du Mount Sinai Hospital de New York ont ​​effectué le première greffe complète de trachée. 

La procédure de 18 heures comprenait la récolte d'une trachée d'un donneur et son implantation chez le patient, reliant de nombreuses veines et artères pour fournir un flux sanguin suffisant vers l'organe.


== Autres animaux ==

En tenant compte des variations de la longueur du cou, la trachée des autres mammifères est, en général, similaire à celle des humains. 

Généralement, il est également similaire à la trachée reptilienne.


=== Vertébrés ===

Chez les oiseaux, la trachée s'étend du pharynx au syrinx, d'où divergent les bronches primaires. 

Les cygnes ont une trachée exceptionnellement allongée, dont une partie est enroulée sous le sternum; cela peut agir comme un résonateur pour amplifier le son.

Chez certains oiseaux, les anneaux trachéaux sont complets et peuvent même être ossifiés. Chez les amphibiens, la trachée est normalement extrêmement courte et mène directement aux poumons, sans bronches primaires claires.

On trouve cependant une trachée plus longue chez certaines salamandres à long cou et chez les cécilies.

Bien qu'il existe des nodules cartilagineux irréguliers sur la trachée des amphibiens, ceux-ci ne forment pas les anneaux trouvés chez les amniotes. Les seuls vertébrés à avoir des poumons, mais pas de trachée, sont le poisson-poumon et le Polypterus, dans lequel les poumons proviennent directement du pharynx.


=== Invertébrés ===


Le mot trachée est utilisé pour définir un organe très différent chez les invertébrés que chez les vertébrés. 

Les insectes ont un système respiratoire ouvert composé de stigmates, de trachées et de trachéoles pour transporter les gaz métaboliques vers et depuis les tissus. 

La distribution des spiracles peut varier considérablement parmi les nombreux ordres d'insectes, mais en général, chaque segment du corps ne peut avoir qu'une seule paire de spiracles, chacun se connectant à un atrium et ayant un tube trachéal relativement grand derrière lui. 

Les trachées sont des invaginations de l'exosquelette cuticulaire qui se ramifient (s'anastomosent) dans tout le corps avec des diamètres de seulement quelques micromètres jusqu'à 0,8 mm. 

La diffusion d'oxygène et de dioxyde de carbone se produit à travers les parois des plus petits tubes, appelés trachéoles, qui pénètrent dans les tissus et même indentent les cellules individuelles. 

Le gaz peut être conduit à travers le système respiratoire au moyen d'une ventilation active ou d'une diffusion passive. 

Contrairement aux vertébrés, les insectes ne transportent généralement pas d'oxygène dans leur hémolymphe.
C'est l'un des facteurs qui peuvent limiter leur taille.
Un tube trachéal peut contenir des anneaux circonférentiels en forme de crête de taenidia dans diverses géométries telles que des boucles ou des hélices. 

Taenidia apporte force et souplesse à la trachée. 

Dans la tête, le thorax ou l'abdomen, les trachées peuvent également être reliées à des sacs aériens. 

De nombreux insectes, tels que les sauterelles et les abeilles, qui pompent activement les sacs aériens de leur abdomen, sont capables de contrôler le flux d'air dans leur corps. 

Chez certains insectes aquatiques, les trachées échangent directement du gaz à travers la paroi corporelle, sous la forme d'une branchie, ou fonctionnent essentiellement comme d'habitude, via un plastron. 

Notez qu'en dépit d'être interne, les trachées des arthropodes sont tapissées de tissu cuticulaire et se détachent lors de la mue (ecdysis).

TRAQUÉIA


A traqueia, também conhecida como traqueia, é um tubo cartilaginoso que liga a laringe aos brônquios dos pulmões, permitindo a passagem do ar, e por isso está presente em quase todos os animais com respiração aérea e pulmões.

A traqueia se estende da laringe e se ramifica nos dois brônquios primários.

No topo da traqueia, a cartilagem cricóide a liga à laringe.

A traqueia é formada por uma série de anéis em forma de ferradura, unidos verticalmente por ligamentos sobrejacentes e pelo músculo traqueal em suas extremidades.

A epiglote fecha a abertura da laringe durante a deglutição.
A traqueia começa a se formar no segundo mês de desenvolvimento do embrião, tornando-se mais longa e mais fixa em sua posição ao longo do tempo.

É um epitélio revestido por células em forma de coluna que possuem extensões semelhantes a cabelos chamadas cílios, com células caliciformes espalhadas que produzem mucinas protetoras.

A traqueia pode ser afetada por inflamação ou infecção, geralmente como resultado de uma doença viral que afeta outras partes do trato respiratório, como a laringe e os brônquios, chamado garupa, que pode resultar em tosse.

A infecção por bactérias geralmente afeta apenas a traqueia e pode causar estreitamento ou até obstrução.

Como uma parte importante do trato respiratório, quando obstruída, a traqueia impede que o ar entre nos pulmões e, portanto, uma traqueostomia pode ser necessária se a traqueia estiver obstruída.

Além disso, durante a cirurgia, se a ventilação mecânica for necessária quando uma pessoa estiver sedada, um tubo é inserido na traqueia, chamado de intubação.

A palavra traqueia é usada para definir um órgão muito diferente nos invertebrados do que nos vertebrados.

Os insetos têm um sistema respiratório aberto composto de espiráculos, traqueias e traqueolas para transportar gases metabólicos de e para os tecidos.


== Estrutura ==


A traqueia de um adulto tem um diâmetro interno de cerca de 1,5 a 2 centímetros (0,59 a 0,79 polegadas) e um comprimento de cerca de 10 a 11 centímetros (3,9 a 4,3 polegadas); mais largas nos machos do que nas fêmeas.

Começa na parte inferior da laringe e termina na carina, o ponto onde a traqueia se ramifica nos brônquios principais esquerdo e direito.

A traqueia é circundada por 16 a 20 anéis de cartilagem hialina; esses 'anéis' têm 4 milímetros de altura no adulto, incompletos e em forma de C.

Os ligamentos conectam os anéis.

O músculo traqueal conecta as extremidades dos anéis incompletos e corre ao longo da parede posterior da traqueia.

Também a adventícia, que é a camada mais externa de tecido conjuntivo que envolve a cartilagem hialina, contribui para a capacidade da traqueia de dobrar e esticar com o movimento.

A traqueia começa na borda inferior da cartilagem cricóide da laringe e termina na carina, ponto onde a traqueia se ramifica em brônquios principais esquerdo e direito. 

A traqueia começa no nível da sexta vértebra cervical (C6), e a carina se encontra no nível da quarta vértebra torácica (T4), embora sua posição possa mudar com a respiração.


=== Estruturas próximas ===

A traqueia passa por muitas estruturas do pescoço e tórax (tórax) ao longo de seu curso.
Na frente da traqueia superior encontra-se o tecido conjuntivo e a pele. 

Várias outras estruturas passam ou ficam na traqueia; o arco jugular, que une as duas veias jugulares anteriores, situa-se na frente da parte superior da traqueia.

Os músculos esterno-hióideo e esternotireóideo se estendem ao longo de seu comprimento.

A glândula tireoide também se estende pela traqueia superior, com o istmo cobrindo o segundo ao quarto anéis, e os lobos se estendendo até o nível da quinta ou sexta cartilagem.

Os vasos sanguíneos da tireoide repousam na traqueia ao lado do istmo; as artérias tireóideas superiores unem-se logo acima dela e as veias tireóideas inferiores abaixo dela.

Na frente da traqueia inferior encontra-se o manúbrio do esterno, os remanescentes do timo em adultos.

À esquerda frontal estão os grandes vasos sanguíneos o arco aórtico e seus ramos a artéria carótida comum esquerda e o tronco braquiocefálico; e a veia braquiocefálica esquerda.

O plexo cardíaco profundo e os linfonodos também estão posicionados na frente da traqueia inferior. Atrás da traqueia, ao longo de seu comprimento, fica o esôfago, seguido pelo tecido conjuntivo e pela coluna vertebral.

Para seus lados correm as artérias carótidas e as artérias tireóideas inferiores; e para os lados, na superfície posterior, correm os nervos laríngeos recorrentes na traqueia superior e os nervos vagos na traqueia inferior.

O músculo traqueal se contrai durante a tosse, reduzindo o tamanho do lúmen da traqueia.

 


=== Suprimento sanguíneo e linfático ===


A parte superior da traqueia recebe e drena o sangue através das artérias e veias tireóideas inferiores; a traqueia inferior recebe sangue das artérias brônquicas.

As artérias que suprem a traqueia o fazem por meio de pequenos ramos que suprem a traqueia pelos lados. 

À medida que os ramos se aproximam da parede da traqueia, dividem-se em ramos inferior e superior, que se unem aos ramos das artérias acima e abaixo; estes então se dividem em ramos que suprem as partes anterior e posterior da traqueia.

As artérias tireoidianas inferiores surgem logo abaixo do istmo da tireoide, que fica no topo da traqueia. 

Essas artérias unem-se (anastamoses) com ramos ascendentes das artérias brônquicas, que são ramos diretos da aorta, para fornecer sangue à traqueia. 

Os vasos linfáticos da traqueia drenam para os linfonodos pré-traqueais que ficam na frente da traqueia e para os linfonodos paratraqueais que ficam ao lado dela.


=== Desenvolvimento ===

Na quarta semana de desenvolvimento do embrião humano, à medida que o broto respiratório cresce, a traqueia se separa do intestino anterior através da formação de sulcos que eventualmente separam a traqueia do esôfago, o septo traqueoesofágico.

Isso separa a futura traqueia do esôfago e divide o tubo do intestino anterior no tubo laringotraqueal.

No início da quinta semana, os brônquios principais esquerdo e direito começam a se formar, inicialmente como brotos na extremidade terminal da traqueia. de aproximadamente 2 cm no final da infância.

A traqueia é mais circular e mais vertical nas crianças em relação aos adultos, varia mais em tamanho e também varia mais em sua posição em relação às estruturas circundantes.


=== Microanatomia ===

A traqueia é revestida por uma camada de camadas intercaladas de células em forma de coluna com cílios. 

O epitélio contém células caliciformes, que são células glandulares em forma de coluna que produzem mucinas, o principal componente do muco. 

O muco ajuda a umedecer e proteger as vias aéreas. 

O muco reveste as células ciliadas da traqueia para prender partículas estranhas inaladas que os cílios então sobem em direção à laringe e depois à faringe, onde podem ser engolidas para o estômago ou expelidas como fleuma. 

Esse mecanismo de autolimpeza é denominado depuração mucociliar. A traqueia é circundada por 16 a 20 anéis de cartilagem hialina; esses 'anéis' são incompletos e em forma de C.

Duas ou mais cartilagens geralmente se unem, parcial ou completamente, e às vezes são bifurcadas em suas extremidades.

Os anéis são geralmente altamente elásticos, mas podem calcificar com a idade.

 
 


== Função ==

A traqueia é uma parte da árvore respiratória que é um canal para o ar passar em seu caminho para ou dos alvéolos dos pulmões.

Isso transmite oxigênio para o corpo e remove o dióxido de carbono.


== Use para matar humanos ==

Esmagar a traqueia é uma tática comum para incapacitar temporariamente ou permanentemente outro ser humano e é ensinada nas forças militares, artes marciais e policiais em todo o mundo.


== Significado clínico ==



=== Inflamação e infecção ===

A inflamação da traqueia é conhecida como traqueíte, geralmente devido a uma infecção.

Geralmente é causada por infecções virais, com infecções bacterianas ocorrendo quase inteiramente em crianças.

Mais comumente, as infecções ocorrem com inflamação de outras partes do trato respiratório, como laringe e brônquios, conhecido como crupe, porém infecções bacterianas também podem afetar a traqueia isoladamente, embora muitas vezes estejam associadas a uma infecção viral recente. 

Os vírus que causam crupe são geralmente os vírus parainfluenza 1-3, com os vírus influenza A e B também causando crupe, mas geralmente causando infecções mais graves; As bactérias também podem causar garupa e incluem Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae e Moraxella catarrhalis.

As causas de infecção bacteriana da traqueia são mais comumente Staphylococcus aureus e Streptococcus pneumoniae. 

Em pacientes hospitalizados, bactérias adicionais que podem causar traqueíte incluem Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae e Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Uma pessoa afetada com traqueíte pode começar com sintomas que sugerem uma infecção do trato respiratório superior, como tosse, dor de garganta ou coriza sintomas como corrimento nasal. 

Febres podem se desenvolver e uma criança afetada pode desenvolver dificuldade para respirar e sepse. 

O inchaço das vias aéreas pode causar estreitamento das vias aéreas, causando um som rouco de respiração chamado estridor, ou até mesmo causar bloqueio completo. 

Infelizmente, até 80% das pessoas acometidas por traqueíte bacteriana necessitam do uso de ventilação mecânica, e o tratamento pode incluir endoscopia para obtenção de espécimes microbiológicos para cultura e sensibilidade, bem como a remoção de qualquer tecido morto associado à infecção.

O tratamento em tais situações geralmente inclui antibióticos.


=== Estreitando ===


Uma traqueia pode ser estreitada ou comprimida, geralmente como resultado de linfonodos próximos aumentados; cânceres da traqueia ou estruturas próximas; grandes bócios da tireóide; ou raramente como resultado de outros processos, como vasos sanguíneos anormalmente inchados.

Cicatrizes de lesão traqueobrônquica ou intubação; ou inflamação associada à granulomatose com poliangeíte também pode causar estreitamento da traqueia (estenose traqueal).

A obstrução invariavelmente causa um som de respiração áspero conhecido como estridor.

Uma câmera inserida pela boca na traqueia, chamada broncoscopia, pode ser realizada para investigar a causa de uma obstrução.

O manejo das obstruções depende da causa.

Obstruções como resultado de malignidade podem ser tratadas com cirurgia, quimioterapia ou radioterapia.

Um stent pode ser inserido sobre a obstrução.

Lesões benignas, como o estreitamento resultante de cicatrizes, provavelmente serão excisadas cirurgicamente. fora, devido à diminuição da adesão.

Pode ser devido a causas congênitas ou devido a coisas que se desenvolvem após o nascimento, como compressão de massas próximas ou inchaço ou trauma. 

A traqueomalácia congênita pode ocorrer sozinha ou associada a outras anormalidades como broncomalácia ou laringomalácia, conexões anormais entre a traqueia e o esôfago, entre outras. 

A traqueomalácia congênita geralmente melhora sem intervenção específica; quando necessário, as intervenções podem incluir agonistas beta e agonistas muscarínicos, que aumentam o tônus ​​do músculo liso que circunda a traqueia; ventilação com pressão positiva ou cirurgia, que pode incluir a colocação de um stent ou a remoção da parte afetada da traqueia.

Em cães, particularmente cães em miniatura e cães de brinquedo, a traqueomalácia, assim como a broncomalácia, pode levar ao colapso traqueal, que geralmente se apresenta com uma tosse tipo ganso buzinando.


=== Intubação ===


A intubação traqueal refere-se à inserção de um tubo na traqueia.

Este procedimento é comumente realizado durante a cirurgia, a fim de garantir que uma pessoa receba oxigênio suficiente quando sedada.

O cateter é conectado a uma máquina que monitora o fluxo de ar, oxigenação e várias outras métricas.

Esta é muitas vezes uma das responsabilidades de um anestesista durante a cirurgia.
Em uma emergência, ou quando a intubação traqueal é considerada impossível, uma traqueotomia é frequentemente realizada para inserir um tubo para ventilação, geralmente quando necessário para determinados tipos de cirurgia a serem realizados para que a via aérea possa ser mantida aberta.

A provisão da abertura através de uma traqueotomia é chamada de traqueostomia. 

Outro método de procedimento pode ser realizado, em situação de emergência, e esta é a cricotirotomia.


=== Distúrbios congênitos ===


A agenesia traqueal é um defeito congênito raro no qual a traqueia não se desenvolve. 

O defeito geralmente é fatal, embora algumas vezes a intervenção cirúrgica tenha sido bem-sucedida.
Uma fístula traqueoesofágica é um defeito congênito no qual a traqueia e o esôfago estão anormalmente conectados (uma fístula). 

Isso ocorre devido a anormalidades na separação entre a traqueia e o esôfago durante o desenvolvimento. 

Isso ocorre em aproximadamente 1 em 3.000 nascimentos, e a anormalidade mais comum é a separação das extremidades superior e inferior do esôfago, com a extremidade superior terminando em uma bolsa fechada. 

Outras anormalidades podem estar associadas a isso, incluindo anormalidades cardíacas ou síndrome de VACTERL. 

Essas fístulas podem ser detectadas antes do nascimento do bebê devido ao excesso de líquido amniótico; após o nascimento, muitas vezes estão associadas a pneumonite e pneumonia devido à aspiração de conteúdo alimentar.

As fístulas congênitas são frequentemente tratadas por reparo cirúrgico. 

Em adultos, as fístulas podem ocorrer devido à erosão na traqueia de tumores malignos próximos, que erodem tanto a traqueia quanto o esôfago. 

Inicialmente, isso geralmente resulta em tosse do conteúdo deglutido do esôfago que é aspirado pela traqueia, geralmente evoluindo para pneumonia fatal; infelizmente, raramente há um tratamento curativo.

Uma punção traqueoesofágica é um orifício criado cirurgicamente entre a traqueia e o esôfago em uma pessoa que teve sua laringe removida. 

O ar viaja para cima da conexão cirúrgica para o esôfago superior e a faringe, criando vibrações que criam som que pode ser usado para falar. 

O objetivo da punção é restaurar a capacidade da pessoa de falar após a remoção das cordas vocais. Às vezes, como uma variação anatômica, um ou mais anéis traqueais são formados como anéis completos, em vez de anéis em forma de ferradura. 

Esses anéis O são menores que os anéis normais em forma de C e podem causar estreitamento (estenose) da traqueia, resultando em dificuldades respiratórias. 

Uma operação chamada traqueoplastia deslizante pode abrir os anéis e juntá-los como anéis mais largos, encurtando o comprimento da traqueia. 

A traqueoplastia com lâmina é considerada a melhor opção no tratamento da estenose traqueal. A síndrome de Mounier-Kuhn é uma doença congênita rara de uma traqueia anormalmente aumentada, caracterizada por fibras elásticas ausentes, afinamento do músculo liso e tendência a infecções recorrentes do trato respiratório.


=== Substituição ===

A partir de 2008, as operações passaram a substituir experimentalmente as traqueias, por aquelas cultivadas a partir de células-tronco, ou por substitutos sintéticos, mas isso é considerado experimental e não há método padronizado.

Dificuldades em garantir suprimento sanguíneo adequado para a traqueia substituída são consideradas um grande desafio para qualquer substituição.

Além disso, nenhuma evidência foi encontrada para apoiar a colocação de células-tronco retiradas da medula óssea na traqueia como forma de estimular a regeneração tecidual, e esse método permanece hipotético. primeiro transplante completo de traqueia.

O procedimento de 18 horas incluiu a colheita de uma traqueia de um doador e a implantação no paciente, conectando várias veias e artérias para fornecer fluxo sanguíneo suficiente ao órgão.


== Outros animais ==

Permitindo variações no comprimento do pescoço, a traqueia em outros mamíferos é, em geral, semelhante à dos humanos.

Geralmente, também é semelhante à traqueia reptiliana.


=== Vertebrados ===

Nas aves, a traqueia vai da faringe à siringe, da qual divergem os brônquios primários.

Os cisnes têm uma traqueia incomumente alongada, parte da qual está enrolada sob o esterno; isso pode atuar como um ressonador para amplificar o som.

Em algumas aves, os anéis traqueais estão completos, podendo até estar ossificados. Nos anfíbios, a traqueia normalmente é extremamente curta e leva diretamente aos pulmões, sem brônquios primários claros.

Uma traqueia mais longa é, no entanto, encontrada em algumas salamandras de pescoço longo e em cecílias.

Embora existam nódulos cartilaginosos irregulares na traqueia dos anfíbios, estes não formam os anéis encontrados nos amniotas. Os únicos vertebrados a ter pulmões, mas não a traqueia, são o peixe pulmonado e o Polypterus, nos quais os pulmões surgem diretamente da faringe.


=== Invertebrados ===


A palavra traqueia é usada para definir um órgão muito diferente nos invertebrados do que nos vertebrados.

Os insetos têm um sistema respiratório aberto composto de espiráculos, traqueias e traqueolas para transportar gases metabólicos de e para os tecidos. 

A distribuição dos espiráculos pode variar muito entre as muitas ordens de insetos, mas em geral cada segmento do corpo pode ter apenas um par de espiráculos, cada um dos quais se conecta a um átrio e possui um tubo traqueal relativamente grande atrás dele. 

As traqueias são invaginações do exoesqueleto cuticular que se ramificam (anastomose) por todo o corpo com diâmetros de apenas alguns micrômetros até 0,8 mm. 

A difusão de oxigênio e dióxido de carbono ocorre através das paredes dos menores tubos, chamados traqueolas, que penetram nos tecidos e até mesmo nas células individuais. 

O gás pode ser conduzido através do sistema respiratório por meio de ventilação ativa ou difusão passiva. 

Ao contrário dos vertebrados, os insetos geralmente não carregam oxigênio em sua hemolinfa.
Este é um dos fatores que podem limitar seu tamanho.
Um tubo traqueal pode conter anéis circunferenciais semelhantes a cristas de taenídios em várias geometrias, como alças ou hélices.

Taenidia fornece força e flexibilidade à traqueia.

Na cabeça, tórax ou abdome, as traqueias também podem estar conectadas a sacos aéreos.

Muitos insetos, como gafanhotos e abelhas, que bombeiam ativamente os sacos de ar em seu abdômen, são capazes de controlar o fluxo de ar através de seu corpo.

Em alguns insetos aquáticos, as traqueias trocam gases através da parede do corpo diretamente, na forma de uma brânquia, ou funcionam essencialmente normalmente, por meio de um plastrão.

Note que apesar de serem internas, as traqueias dos artrópodes são revestidas com tecido cuticular e são descamadas durante a muda (ecdise).
