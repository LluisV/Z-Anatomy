RETICULAR FORMATION


The reticular formation is a set of interconnected nuclei that are located throughout the brainstem. 

It is not anatomically well defined, because it includes neurons located in different parts of the brain. 

The neurons of the reticular formation make up a complex set of networks in the core of the brainstem that extend from the upper part of the midbrain to the lower part of the medulla oblongata. 

The reticular formation includes ascending pathways to the cortex in the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) and descending pathways to the spinal cord via the reticulospinal tracts.

Neurons of the reticular formation, particularly those of the ascending reticular activating system, play a crucial role in maintaining behavioral arousal and consciousness. 

The overall functions of the reticular formation are modulatory and premotor, involving somatic motor control, cardiovascular control, pain modulation, sleep and consciousness, and habituation. 

The modulatory functions are primarily found in the rostral sector of the reticular formation and the premotor functions are localized in the neurons in more caudal regions.

The reticular formation is divided into three columns: raphe nuclei (median), gigantocellular reticular nuclei (medial zone), and parvocellular reticular nuclei (lateral zone). 

The raphe nuclei are the place of synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which plays an important role in mood regulation. 

The gigantocellular nuclei are involved in motor coordination. 

The parvocellular nuclei regulate exhalation.

The reticular formation is essential for governing some of the basic functions of higher organisms and is one of the phylogenetically oldest portions of the brain.


== Structure ==


The human reticular formation is composed of almost 100 brain nuclei and contains many projections into the forebrain, brainstem, and cerebellum, among other regions. 

It includes the reticular nuclei, reticulothalamic projection fibers, diffuse thalamocortical projections, ascending cholinergic projections, descending non-cholinergic projections, and descending reticulospinal projections. 

The reticular formation also contains two major neural subsystems, the ascending reticular activating system and descending reticulospinal tracts, which mediate distinct cognitive and physiological processes. 

It has been functionally cleaved both sagittally and coronally.
Traditionally the reticular nuclei are divided into three columns:

In the median column – the raphe nuclei.

In the medial column – gigantocellular nuclei (because of larger size of the cells).

In the lateral column – parvocellular nuclei (because of smaller size of the cells).

The original functional differentiation was a division of caudal and rostral. 

This was based upon the observation that the lesioning of the rostral reticular formation induces a hypersomnia in the cat brain. 

In contrast, lesioning of the more caudal portion of the reticular formation produces insomnia in cats. 

This study has led to the idea that the caudal portion inhibits the rostral portion of the reticular formation.

Sagittal division reveals more morphological distinctions. 

The raphe nuclei form a ridge in the middle of the reticular formation, and, directly to its periphery, there is a division called the medial reticular formation. 

The medial RF is large and has long ascending and descending fibers, and is surrounded by the lateral reticular formation. 

The lateral RF is close to the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, and mostly mediates their function.


=== Medial and lateral reticular formation ===

The medial reticular formation and lateral reticular formation are two columns of nuclei with ill-defined boundaries that send projections through the medulla and into the midbrain. 

The nuclei can be differentiated by function, cell type, and projections of efferent or afferent nerves. 

Moving caudally from the rostral midbrain, at the site of the rostral pons and the midbrain, the medial RF becomes less prominent, and the lateral RF becomes more prominent.

Existing on the sides of the medial reticular formation is its lateral cousin, which is particularly pronounced in the rostral medulla and caudal pons. 

Out from this area spring the cranial nerves, including the very important vagus nerve. 

The lateral RF is known for its ganglions and areas of interneurons around the cranial nerves, which serve to mediate their characteristic reflexes and functions.


== Function ==

The reticular formation consists of more than 100 small neural networks, with varied functions including the following:

Somatic motor control – Some motor neurons send their axons to the reticular formation nuclei, giving rise to the reticulospinal tracts of the spinal cord. 

These tracts function in maintaining tone, balance, and posture—especially during body movements. 

The reticular formation also relays eye and ear signals to the cerebellum so that the cerebellum can integrate visual, auditory, and vestibular stimuli in motor coordination. 

Other motor nuclei include gaze centers, which enable the eyes to track and fixate objects, and central pattern generators, which produce rhythmic signals of breathing and swallowing.

Cardiovascular control – The reticular formation includes the cardiac and vasomotor centers of the medulla oblongata.

Pain modulation – The reticular formation is one means by which pain signals from the lower body reach the cerebral cortex. 

It is also the origin of the descending analgesic pathways. 

The nerve fibers in these pathways act in the spinal cord to block the transmission of some pain signals to the brain.

Sleep and consciousness – The reticular formation has projections to the thalamus and cerebral cortex that allow it to exert some control over which sensory signals reach the cerebrum and come to our conscious attention. 

It plays a central role in states of consciousness like alertness and sleep. 

Injury to the reticular formation can result in irreversible coma.

Habituation – This is a process in which the brain learns to ignore repetitive, meaningless stimuli while remaining sensitive to others. 

A good example of this is a person who can sleep through loud traffic in a large city, but is awakened promptly due to the sound of an alarm or crying baby. 

Reticular formation nuclei that modulate activity of the cerebral cortex are part of the ascending reticular activating system.


== Major subsystems ==

=== Ascending reticular activating system ===


The ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), also known as the extrathalamic control modulatory system or simply the reticular activating system (RAS), is a set of connected nuclei in the brains of vertebrates that is responsible for regulating wakefulness and sleep-wake transitions. 

The ARAS is a part of the reticular formation and is mostly composed of various nuclei in the thalamus and a number of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic brain nuclei.


==== Structure of the ARAS ====

The ARAS is composed of several neural circuits connecting the dorsal part of the posterior midbrain and anterior pons to the cerebral cortex via distinct pathways that project through the thalamus and hypothalamus. 

The ARAS is a collection of different nuclei – more than 20 on each side in the upper brainstem, the pons, medulla, and posterior hypothalamus. 

The neurotransmitters that these neurons release include dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine, acetylcholine, and glutamate. 

They exert cortical influence through direct axonal projections and indirect projections through thalamic relays.

The thalamic pathway consists primarily of cholinergic neurons in the pontine tegmentum, whereas the hypothalamic pathway is composed primarily of neurons that release monoamine neurotransmitters, namely dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine. 

The glutamate-releasing neurons in the ARAS were identified much more recently relative to the monoaminergic and cholinergic nuclei; the glutamatergic component of the ARAS includes one nucleus in the hypothalamus and various brainstem nuclei. 

The orexin neurons of the lateral hypothalamus innervate every component of the ascending reticular activating system and coordinate activity within the entire system.

The ARAS consists of evolutionarily ancient areas of the brain, which are crucial to the animal's survival and protected during adverse periods, such as during inhibitory periods of Totsellreflex, aka, "animal hypnosis".

The ascending reticular activating system which sends neuromodulatory projections to the cortex - mainly connects to the prefrontal cortex. 

There seems to be low connectivity to the motor areas of the cortex.


==== Functions of the ARAS ====


===== Consciousness =====

The ascending reticular activating system is an important enabling factor for the state of consciousness. 

The ascending system is seen to contribute to wakefulness as characterised by cortical and behavioural arousal.


===== Regulating sleep-wake transitions =====

The main function of the ARAS is to modify and potentiate thalamic and cortical function such that electroencephalogram (EEG) desynchronization ensues. 

There are distinct differences in the brain's electrical activity during periods of wakefulness and sleep: 

Low voltage fast burst brain waves (EEG desynchronization) are associated with wakefulness and REM sleep (which are electrophysiologically similar); high voltage slow waves are found during non-REM sleep. 

Generally speaking, when thalamic relay neurons are in burst mode the EEG is synchronized and when they are in tonic mode it is desynchronized. 

Stimulation of the ARAS produces EEG desynchronization by suppressing slow cortical waves (0.3–1 Hz), delta waves (1–4 Hz), and spindle wave oscillations (11–14 Hz) and by promoting gamma band (20 – 40 Hz) oscillations.

The physiological change from a state of deep sleep to wakefulness is reversible and mediated by the ARAS. 

The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) of the hypothalamus inhibits the neural circuits responsible for the awake state, and VLPO activation contributes to the sleep onset. 

During sleep, neurons in the ARAS will have a much lower firing rate; conversely, they will have a higher activity level during the waking state. 

In order that the brain may sleep, there must be a reduction in ascending afferent activity reaching the cortex by suppression of the ARAS.


===== Attention =====

The ARAS also helps mediate transitions from relaxed wakefulness to periods of high attention. 

There is increased regional blood flow (presumably indicating an increased measure of neuronal activity) in the midbrain reticular formation (MRF) and thalamic intralaminar nuclei during tasks requiring increased alertness and attention.


==== Clinical significance of the ARAS ====

Mass lesions in brainstem ARAS nuclei can cause severe alterations in level of consciousness (e.g., coma). 

Bilateral damage to the reticular formation of the midbrain may lead to coma or death.

Direct electrical stimulation of the ARAS produces pain responses in cats and elicits verbal reports of pain in humans. 

Ascending reticular activation in cats can produce mydriasis, which can result from prolonged pain. 

These results suggest some relationship between ARAS circuits and physiological pain pathways.


===== Pathologies =====

Some pathologies of the ARAS may be attributed to age, as there appears to be a general decline in reactivity of the ARAS with advancing years. 

Changes in electrical coupling have been suggested to account for some changes in ARAS activity: if coupling were down-regulated, there would be a corresponding decrease in higher-frequency synchronization (gamma band). 

Conversely, up-regulated electrical coupling would increase synchronization of fast rhythms that could lead to increased arousal and REM sleep drive. 

Specifically, disruption of the ARAS has been implicated in the following disorders:

Narcolepsy: Lesions along the pedunculopontine (PPT/PPN) / laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) nuclei are associated with narcolepsy. 

There is a significant down-regulation of PPN output and a loss of orexin peptides, promoting the excessive daytime sleepiness that is characteristic of this disorder.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) : 
Dysfunction of nitrous oxide signaling has been implicated in the development of PSP.

Parkinson's disease: REM sleep disturbances are common in Parkinson's. 

It is mainly a dopaminergic disease, but cholinergic nuclei are depleted as well. 

Degeneration in the ARAS begins early in the disease process.


====== Developmental influences ======

There are several potential factors that may adversely influence the development of the ascending reticular activating system:

Preterm birth: 

Regardless of birth weight or weeks of gestation, premature birth induces persistent deleterious effects on pre-attentional (arousal and sleep-wake abnormalities), attentional (reaction time and sensory gating), and cortical mechanisms throughout development.

Smoking during pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal, attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. 

This exposure can induce up-regulation of α4β2 nicotinic receptors on cells of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), resulting in increased tonic activity, resting membrane potential, and hyperpolarization-activated cation current. 

These major disturbances of the intrinsic membrane properties of PPN neurons result in increased levels of arousal and sensory gating, deficits (demonstrated by a diminished amount of habituation to repeated auditory stimuli). 

It is hypothesized that these physiological changes may intensify attentional dysregulation later in life.


=== Descending reticulospinal tracts ===


The reticulospinal tracts, also known as the descending or anterior reticulospinal tracts, are extrapyramidal motor tracts that descend from the reticular formation in two tracts to act on the motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors. 

The reticulospinal tracts are involved mainly in locomotion and postural control, although they do have other functions as well. 

The descending reticulospinal tracts are one of four major cortical pathways to the spinal cord for musculoskeletal activity. 

The reticulospinal tracts works with the other three pathways to give a coordinated control of movement, including delicate manipulations. 

The four pathways can be grouped into two main system pathways – a medial system and a lateral system. 

The medial system includes the reticulospinal pathway and the vestibulospinal pathway, and this system provides control of posture. 

The corticospinal and the rubrospinal tract pathways belong to the lateral system which provides fine control of movement.


==== Components of the reticulospinal tracts ====

This descending tract is divided into two parts, the medial (or pontine) and lateral (or medullary) reticulospinal tracts (MRST and LRST).

The MRST is responsible for exciting anti-gravity, extensor muscles. 

The fibers of this tract arise from the caudal pontine reticular nucleus and the oral pontine reticular nucleus and project to lamina VII and lamina VIII of the spinal cord.

The LRST is responsible for inhibiting excitatory axial extensor muscles of movement. 

It is also responsible for automatic breathing. 

The fibers of this tract arise from the medullary reticular formation, mostly from the gigantocellular nucleus, and descend the length of the spinal cord in the anterior part of the lateral column. 

The tract terminates in lamina VII mostly with some fibers terminating in lamina IX of the spinal cord.

The ascending sensory tract conveying information in the opposite direction is known as the spinoreticular tract.


==== Functions of the reticulospinal tracts ====

Integrates information from the motor systems to coordinate automatic movements of locomotion and posture

Facilitates and inhibits voluntary movement; influences muscle tone

Mediates autonomic functions

Modulates pain impulses

Influences blood flow to lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.


==== Clinical significance of the reticulospinal tracts ====

The reticulospinal tracts provide a pathway by which the hypothalamus can control sympathetic thoracolumbar outflow and parasympathetic sacral outflow.

Two major descending systems carrying signals from the brainstem and cerebellum to the spinal cord can trigger automatic postural response for balance and orientation: 

vestibulospinal tracts from the vestibular nuclei and reticulospinal tracts from the pons and medulla. 

Lesions of these tracts result in profound ataxia and postural instability.

Physical or vascular damage to the brainstem disconnecting the red nucleus (midbrain) and the vestibular nuclei (pons) may cause decerebrate rigidity, which has the neurological sign of increased muscle tone and hyperactive stretch reflexes. 

Responding to a startling or painful stimulus, both arms and legs extend and turn internally. 

The cause is the tonic activity of lateral vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts stimulating extensor motoneurons without the inhibitions from rubrospinal tract.

Brainstem damage above the red nucleus level may cause decorticate rigidity. 

Responding to a startling or painful stimulus, the arms flex and the legs extend. 

The cause is the red nucleus, via the rubrospinal tract, counteracting the extensor motorneuron's excitation from the lateral vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts. 

Because the rubrospinal tract only extends to the cervical spinal cord, it mostly acts on the arms by exciting the flexor muscles and inhibiting the extensors, rather than the legs.

Damage to the medulla below the vestibular nuclei may cause flaccid paralysis, hypotonia, loss of respiratory drive, and quadriplegia. 

There are no reflexes resembling early stages of spinal shock because of complete loss of activity in the motorneurons, as there is no longer any tonic activity arising from the lateral vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts.


== History ==

The term "reticular formation" was coined in the late 19th century by Otto Deiters, coinciding with Ramon y Cajal’s neuron doctrine. 

Allan Hobson states in his book The Reticular Formation Revisited that the name is an etymological vestige from the fallen era of the aggregate field theory in the neural sciences. 

The term "reticulum" means "netlike structure", which is what the reticular formation resembles at first glance. 

It has been described as being either too complex to study or an undifferentiated part of the brain with no organization at all. 

Eric Kandel describes the reticular formation as being organized in a similar manner to the intermediate gray matter of the spinal cord. 

This chaotic, loose, and intricate form of organization is what has turned off many researchers from looking farther into this particular area of the brain. 

The cells lack clear ganglionic boundaries, but do have clear functional organization and distinct cell types. 

The term "reticular formation" is seldom used anymore except to speak in generalities. 

Modern scientists usually refer to the individual nuclei that compose the reticular formation.Moruzzi and Magoun first investigated the neural components regulating the brain's sleep-wake mechanisms in 1949. 

Physiologists had proposed that some structure deep within the brain controlled mental wakefulness and alertness. 

It had been thought that wakefulness depended only on the direct reception of afferent (sensory) stimuli at the cerebral cortex.

As direct electrical stimulation of the brain could simulate electrocortical relays, Magoun used this principle to demonstrate, on two separate areas of the brainstem of a cat, how to produce wakefulness from sleep. 

He first stimulated the ascending somatic and auditory paths; second, a series of "ascending relays from the reticular formation of the lower brain stem through the midbrain tegmentum, subthalamus and hypothalamus to the internal capsule." 

The latter was of particular interest, as this series of relays did not correspond to any known anatomical pathways for the wakefulness signal transduction and was coined the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS).

Next, the significance of this newly identified relay system was evaluated by placing lesions in the medial and lateral portions of the front of the midbrain. 

Cats with mesencephalic interruptions to the ARAS entered into a deep sleep and displayed corresponding brain waves. 

In alternative fashion, cats with similarly placed interruptions to ascending auditory and somatic pathways exhibited normal sleeping and wakefulness, and could be awakened with physical stimuli. 

Because these external stimuli would be blocked on their way to the cortex by the interruptions, this indicated that the ascending transmission must travel through the newly discovered ARAS.

Finally, Magoun recorded potentials within the medial portion of the brain stem and discovered that auditory stimuli directly fired portions of the reticular activating system. 

Furthermore, single-shock stimulation of the sciatic nerve also activated the medial reticular formation, hypothalamus, and thalamus. 

Excitation of the ARAS did not depend on further signal propagation through the cerebellar circuits, as the same results were obtained following decerebellation and decortication. 

The researchers proposed that a column of cells surrounding the midbrain reticular formation received input from all the ascending tracts of the brain stem and relayed these afferents to the cortex and therefore regulated wakefulness.

FORMACIÓN RETICULAR


La formación reticular es un conjunto de núcleos interconectados que se localizan a lo largo del tronco encefálico.

No está bien definido anatómicamente, porque incluye neuronas ubicadas en diferentes partes del cerebro.

Las neuronas de la formación reticular forman un conjunto complejo de redes en el núcleo del tronco encefálico que se extienden desde la parte superior del mesencéfalo hasta la parte inferior del bulbo raquídeo.

La formación reticular incluye vías ascendentes a la corteza en el sistema de activación reticular ascendente (ARAS) y vías descendentes a la médula espinal a través de los tractos reticuloespinales.

Las neuronas de la formación reticular, en particular las del sistema activador reticular ascendente, desempeñan un papel crucial en el mantenimiento de la excitación conductual y la conciencia.

Las funciones generales de la formación reticular son moduladoras y premotoras, y comprenden el control motor somático, el control cardiovascular, la modulación del dolor, el sueño y la conciencia, y la habituación.

Las funciones moduladoras se encuentran principalmente en el sector rostral de la formación reticular y las funciones premotoras se localizan en las neuronas en regiones más caudales.

La formación reticular se divide en tres columnas: núcleos del rafe (mediana), núcleos reticulares gigantocelulares (zona media) y núcleos reticulares parvocelulares (zona lateral).

Los núcleos del rafe son el lugar de síntesis del neurotransmisor serotonina, que juega un papel importante en la regulación del estado de ánimo.

Los núcleos gigantocelulares están involucrados en la coordinación motora.

Los núcleos parvocelulares regulan la exhalación.

La formación reticular es esencial para gobernar algunas de las funciones básicas de los organismos superiores y es una de las partes filogenéticamente más antiguas del cerebro.


== Estructura ==


La formación reticular humana está compuesta por casi 100 núcleos cerebrales y contiene muchas proyecciones hacia el prosencéfalo, el tronco encefálico y el cerebelo, entre otras regiones.

Incluye los núcleos reticulares, las fibras de proyección reticulotalámica, las proyecciones talamocorticales difusas, las proyecciones colinérgicas ascendentes, las proyecciones no colinérgicas descendentes y las proyecciones reticuloespinales descendentes. 

La formación reticular también contiene dos subsistemas neurales principales, el sistema de activación reticular ascendente y los tractos reticuloespinales descendentes, que median distintos procesos cognitivos y fisiológicos. 

Se ha escindido funcionalmente tanto sagital como coronalmente.
Tradicionalmente los núcleos reticulares se dividen en tres columnas:

En la columna mediana - los núcleos del rafe.

En la columna medial: núcleos gigantocelulares (debido al mayor tamaño de las células).

En la columna lateral – núcleos parvocelulares (debido al menor tamaño de las células).

La diferenciación funcional original fue una división de caudal y rostral. 

Esto se basó en la observación de que la lesión de la formación reticular rostral induce una hipersomnia en el cerebro del gato.

Por el contrario, la lesión de la porción más caudal de la formación reticular produce insomnio en los gatos.

Este estudio ha llevado a la idea de que la porción caudal inhibe la porción rostral de la formación reticular.

La división sagital revela más distinciones morfológicas.

Los núcleos del rafe forman una cresta en el medio de la formación reticular y, directamente en su periferia, hay una división denominada formación reticular medial.

El FR medial es grande y tiene largas fibras ascendentes y descendentes, y está rodeado por la formación reticular lateral.

El RF lateral está cerca de los núcleos motores de los nervios craneales y, en su mayoría, interviene en su función.


=== Formación reticular medial y lateral ===

La formación reticular medial y la formación reticular lateral son dos columnas de núcleos con límites mal definidos que envían proyecciones a través del bulbo raquídeo y hacia el mesencéfalo. 

Los núcleos se pueden diferenciar por función, tipo de célula y proyecciones de nervios eferentes o aferentes. 

Moviéndose caudalmente desde el mesencéfalo rostral, en el sitio de la protuberancia rostral y el mesencéfalo, el RF medial se vuelve menos prominente y el RF lateral se vuelve más prominente.

A los lados de la formación reticular medial existe su primo lateral, que es particularmente pronunciado en el bulbo raquídeo rostral y la protuberancia caudal. 

De esta zona brotan los nervios craneales, incluido el muy importante nervio vago. 

El RF lateral es conocido por sus ganglios y áreas de interneuronas alrededor de los nervios craneales, que sirven para mediar sus reflejos y funciones característicos.


== Función ==

La formación reticular consta de más de 100 pequeñas redes neuronales, con funciones variadas que incluyen las siguientes:

Control motor somático: algunas neuronas motoras envían sus axones a los núcleos de formación reticular, dando lugar a los tractos reticuloespinales de la médula espinal. 

Estos tractos funcionan para mantener el tono, el equilibrio y la postura, especialmente durante los movimientos del cuerpo. 

La formación reticular también transmite señales oculares y auditivas al cerebelo para que el cerebelo pueda integrar estímulos visuales, auditivos y vestibulares en la coordinación motora. 

Otros núcleos motores incluyen centros de la mirada, que permiten a los ojos seguir y fijar objetos, y generadores de patrones centrales, que producen señales rítmicas de respiración y deglución.

Control cardiovascular: la formación reticular incluye los centros cardíaco y vasomotor del bulbo raquídeo.

Modulación del dolor: la formación reticular es uno de los medios por los cuales las señales de dolor de la parte inferior del cuerpo llegan a la corteza cerebral.

También es el origen de las vías analgésicas descendentes.

Las fibras nerviosas de estas vías actúan en la médula espinal para bloquear la transmisión de algunas señales de dolor al cerebro.

Sueño y conciencia: la formación reticular tiene proyecciones hacia el tálamo y la corteza cerebral que le permiten ejercer cierto control sobre qué señales sensoriales llegan al cerebro y llaman nuestra atención consciente.

Desempeña un papel central en los estados de conciencia como el estado de alerta y el sueño. 

La lesión de la formación reticular puede provocar un coma irreversible.

Habituación: este es un proceso en el que el cerebro aprende a ignorar los estímulos repetitivos y sin sentido mientras permanece sensible a los demás. 

Un buen ejemplo de esto es una persona que puede dormir a través del tráfico ruidoso en una gran ciudad, pero se despierta rápidamente debido al sonido de una alarma o al llanto de un bebé. 

Los núcleos de formación reticular que modulan la actividad de la corteza cerebral forman parte del sistema activador reticular ascendente.


== Subsistemas principales ==

=== Sistema de activación reticular ascendente ===


El sistema activador reticular ascendente (ARAS), también conocido como sistema modulador de control extratalámico o simplemente sistema activador reticular (RAS), es un conjunto de núcleos conectados en el cerebro de los vertebrados que se encarga de regular la vigilia y las transiciones sueño-vigilia. 

El ARAS es parte de la formación reticular y está compuesto principalmente por varios núcleos en el tálamo y varios núcleos cerebrales dopaminérgicos, noradrenérgicos, serotoninérgicos, histaminérgicos, colinérgicos y glutamatérgicos.


==== Estructura del ARAS ====

El ARAS está compuesto por varios circuitos neurales que conectan la parte dorsal del mesencéfalo posterior y la protuberancia anterior con la corteza cerebral a través de distintas vías que se proyectan a través del tálamo y el hipotálamo. 

El ARAS es una colección de diferentes núcleos: más de 20 en cada lado en la parte superior del tronco encefálico, la protuberancia, el bulbo raquídeo y el hipotálamo posterior. 

Los neurotransmisores que liberan estas neuronas incluyen dopamina, norepinefrina, serotonina, histamina, acetilcolina y glutamato. 

Ejercen influencia cortical a través de proyecciones axonales directas y proyecciones indirectas a través de relevos talámicos.

La vía talámica consta principalmente de neuronas colinérgicas en el tegmento pontino, mientras que la vía hipotalámica se compone principalmente de neuronas que liberan neurotransmisores monoamínicos, a saber, dopamina, norepinefrina, serotonina e histamina. 

Las neuronas liberadoras de glutamato en el ARAS se identificaron mucho más recientemente en relación con los núcleos monoaminérgicos y colinérgicos; el componente glutamatérgico del ARAS incluye un núcleo en el hipotálamo y varios núcleos del tronco encefálico.

Las neuronas de orexina del hipotálamo lateral inervan cada componente del sistema de activación reticular ascendente y coordinan la actividad dentro de todo el sistema.

El ARAS consta de áreas del cerebro evolutivamente antiguas, que son cruciales para la supervivencia del animal y están protegidas durante períodos adversos, como durante los períodos inhibidores del reflejo de Totsell, también conocido como "hipnosis animal".

El sistema de activación reticular ascendente que envía proyecciones neuromoduladoras a la corteza, se conecta principalmente a la corteza prefrontal.

Parece haber baja conectividad con las áreas motoras de la corteza.


==== Funciones del ARAS ====


===== Conciencia =====

El sistema de activación reticular ascendente es un factor habilitador importante para el estado de conciencia. 

Se considera que el sistema ascendente contribuye a la vigilia caracterizada por la excitación cortical y conductual.


===== Regulación de las transiciones sueño-vigilia =====

La función principal del ARAS es modificar y potenciar la función talámica y cortical de modo que se produzca la desincronización del electroencefalograma (EEG). 

Hay claras diferencias en la actividad eléctrica del cerebro durante los períodos de vigilia y sueño: 

Las ondas cerebrales de ráfaga rápida de bajo voltaje (desincronización EEG) están asociadas con la vigilia y el sueño REM (que son electrofisiológicamente similares); Las ondas lentas de alto voltaje se encuentran durante el sueño no REM.

En términos generales, cuando las neuronas de relevo talámicas están en modo ráfaga, el EEG está sincronizado y cuando están en modo tónico, está desincronizado.

La estimulación del ARAS produce la desincronización del EEG al suprimir las ondas corticales lentas (0,3 a 1 Hz), las ondas delta (1 a 4 Hz) y las oscilaciones de la onda del huso (11 a 14 Hz) y al promover las oscilaciones de la banda gamma (20 a 40 Hz) .

El cambio fisiológico de un estado de sueño profundo a un estado de vigilia es reversible y está mediado por el ARAS.

El núcleo preóptico ventrolateral (VLPO) del hipotálamo inhibe los circuitos neurales responsables del estado de vigilia, y la activación del VLPO contribuye al inicio del sueño.

Durante el sueño, las neuronas del ARAS tendrán una tasa de activación mucho más baja; por el contrario, tendrán un mayor nivel de actividad durante el estado de vigilia.

Para que el cerebro pueda dormir, debe haber una reducción en la actividad aferente ascendente que llega a la corteza por supresión del ARAS.


===== Atención =====

El ARAS también ayuda a mediar en las transiciones de una vigilia relajada a períodos de alta atención.

Hay un aumento del flujo sanguíneo regional (lo que probablemente indica una mayor medida de la actividad neuronal) en la formación reticular del mesencéfalo (MRF) y los núcleos intralaminares del tálamo durante las tareas que requieren un mayor estado de alerta y atención.


==== Importancia clínica del ARAS ====

Las lesiones masivas en los núcleos ARAS del tronco encefálico pueden causar alteraciones graves en el nivel de conciencia (p. ej., coma).

El daño bilateral a la formación reticular del mesencéfalo puede conducir al coma oa la muerte.

La estimulación eléctrica directa del ARAS produce respuestas de dolor en gatos y provoca informes verbales de dolor en humanos.

La activación reticular ascendente en gatos puede producir midriasis, que puede resultar de un dolor prolongado.

Estos resultados sugieren alguna relación entre los circuitos ARAS y las vías fisiológicas del dolor.


===== Patologías =====

Algunas patologías del ARAS pueden atribuirse a la edad, ya que parece haber una disminución general en la reactividad del ARAS con el paso de los años.

Se han sugerido cambios en el acoplamiento eléctrico para explicar algunos cambios en la actividad de ARAS: si el acoplamiento se regulara a la baja, habría una disminución correspondiente en la sincronización de frecuencia más alta (banda gamma).

Por el contrario, el acoplamiento eléctrico regulado aumentaría la sincronización de ritmos rápidos que podrían conducir a un aumento de la excitación y del sueño REM.

Específicamente, la interrupción del ARAS se ha implicado en los siguientes trastornos:

Narcolepsia: Las lesiones a lo largo de los núcleos pedunculopontino (PPT/PPN) / tegmental laterodorsal (LDT) están asociadas con la narcolepsia. 

Hay una regulación a la baja significativa de la producción de PPN y una pérdida de péptidos de orexina, lo que promueve la somnolencia diurna excesiva que es característica de este trastorno.

Parálisis supranuclear progresiva (PSP) : 
La disfunción de la señalización del óxido nitroso se ha implicado en el desarrollo de la PSP.

Enfermedad de Parkinson: las alteraciones del sueño REM son comunes en la enfermedad de Parkinson. 

Es principalmente una enfermedad dopaminérgica, pero los núcleos colinérgicos también se agotan. 

La degeneración en el ARAS comienza temprano en el proceso de la enfermedad.


====== Influencias del desarrollo ======

Hay varios factores potenciales que pueden influir negativamente en el desarrollo del sistema de activación reticular ascendente:

Parto prematuro: 

Independientemente del peso al nacer o las semanas de gestación, el nacimiento prematuro induce efectos nocivos persistentes en los mecanismos preatencionales (despertar y anomalías del sueño-vigilia), atencionales (tiempo de reacción y activación sensorial) y corticales a lo largo del desarrollo.

Fumar durante el embarazo: se sabe que la exposición prenatal al humo del cigarrillo produce déficits cognitivos, atencionales y de excitación duraderos en los seres humanos.

Esta exposición puede inducir una regulación positiva de los receptores nicotínicos α4β2 en las células del núcleo pedunculopontino (PPN), lo que da como resultado un aumento de la actividad tónica, el potencial de reposo de la membrana y la corriente catiónica activada por hiperpolarización.

Estas alteraciones importantes de las propiedades intrínsecas de la membrana de las neuronas PPN dan como resultado un aumento de los niveles de excitación y déficits de activación sensorial (demostrado por una disminución de la habituación a los estímulos auditivos repetidos). 

Se plantea la hipótesis de que estos cambios fisiológicos pueden intensificar la desregulación atencional más adelante en la vida.


=== Tractos reticuloespinales descendentes ===


Los tractos reticuloespinales, también conocidos como tractos reticuloespinales descendentes o anteriores, son tractos motores extrapiramidales que descienden de la formación reticular en dos tractos para actuar sobre las neuronas motoras que inervan el tronco y los flexores y extensores proximales de las extremidades. 

Los tractos reticuloespinales están involucrados principalmente en la locomoción y el control postural, aunque también tienen otras funciones. 

Los tractos reticuloespinales descendentes son una de las cuatro vías corticales principales hacia la médula espinal para la actividad musculoesquelética.

Los tractos reticuloespinales trabajan con las otras tres vías para brindar un control coordinado del movimiento, incluidas las manipulaciones delicadas.

Las cuatro vías se pueden agrupar en dos vías principales del sistema: un sistema medial y un sistema lateral.

El sistema medial incluye la vía reticuloespinal y la vía vestibuloespinal, y este sistema proporciona control de la postura.

Las vías corticoespinal y rubroespinal pertenecen al sistema lateral que proporciona un control fino del movimiento.


==== Componentes de los tractos reticuloespinales ====

Este tracto descendente se divide en dos partes, los tractos reticuloespinales medial (o pontino) y lateral (o medular) (MRST y LRST).

El MRST es responsable de excitar los músculos extensores antigravedad. 

Las fibras de este tracto surgen del núcleo reticular pontino caudal y del núcleo reticular pontino oral y se proyectan hacia las láminas VII y VIII de la médula espinal.

El LRST es responsable de inhibir el movimiento de los músculos extensores axiales excitatorios. 

También es responsable de la respiración automática. 

Las fibras de este tracto surgen de la formación reticular medular, en su mayoría del núcleo gigantocelular, y descienden a lo largo de la médula espinal en la parte anterior de la columna lateral. 

El tracto termina en la lámina VII en su mayoría con algunas fibras que terminan en la lámina IX de la médula espinal.

El tracto sensorial ascendente que transmite información en la dirección opuesta se conoce como tracto espinorreticular.


==== Funciones de los tractos reticuloespinales ====

Integra información de los sistemas motores para coordinar movimientos automáticos de locomoción y postura.

Facilita e inhibe el movimiento voluntario; influye en el tono muscular

Media funciones autonómicas.

Modula los impulsos del dolor

Influye en el flujo sanguíneo al núcleo geniculado lateral del tálamo.


==== Importancia clínica de los tractos reticuloespinales ====

Los tractos reticuloespinales proporcionan una vía por la cual el hipotálamo puede controlar el flujo de salida toracolumbar simpático y el flujo de salida sacro parasimpático.

Dos grandes sistemas descendentes que transportan señales desde el tronco encefálico y el cerebelo hasta la médula espinal pueden desencadenar una respuesta postural automática para el equilibrio y la orientación:

tractos vestibuloespinales de los núcleos vestibulares y tractos reticuloespinales de la protuberancia y el bulbo raquídeo.

Las lesiones de estos tractos resultan en ataxia profunda e inestabilidad postural.

El daño físico o vascular del tronco del encéfalo que desconecta el núcleo rojo (mesencéfalo) y los núcleos vestibulares (puente) puede causar rigidez de descerebración, que tiene el signo neurológico de aumento del tono muscular y reflejos de estiramiento hiperactivos.

En respuesta a un estímulo sorprendente o doloroso, ambos brazos y piernas se extienden y giran internamente.

La causa es la actividad tónica de los tractos vestibuloespinal lateral y reticuloespinal que estimulan las motoneuronas extensoras sin las inhibiciones del tracto rubroespinal.

El daño del tronco encefálico por encima del nivel del núcleo rojo puede causar rigidez de decorticación.

En respuesta a un estímulo sorprendente o doloroso, los brazos se flexionan y las piernas se extienden.

La causa es el núcleo rojo, a través del tracto rubroespinal, que contrarresta la excitación de la motoneurona extensora de los tractos vestibuloespinal lateral y reticuloespinal.

Debido a que el tracto rubroespinal solo se extiende a la médula espinal cervical, actúa principalmente sobre los brazos al excitar los músculos flexores e inhibir los extensores, en lugar de las piernas.

El daño a la médula debajo de los núcleos vestibulares puede causar parálisis flácida, hipotonía, pérdida del impulso respiratorio y cuadriplejia. 

No hay reflejos que se parezcan a las etapas tempranas del shock espinal debido a la pérdida completa de actividad en las neuronas motoras, ya que ya no hay ninguna actividad tónica que surja de los tractos vestibuloespinal lateral y reticuloespinal.


== Historia ==

El término "formación reticular" fue acuñado a finales del siglo XIX por Otto Deiters, coincidiendo con la doctrina de la neurona de Ramón y Cajal. 

Allan Hobson afirma en su libro The Reticular Formation Revisited que el nombre es un vestigio etimológico de la era caída de la teoría del campo agregado en las ciencias neuronales.

El término "retículo" significa "estructura en forma de red", que es a lo que se parece la formación reticular a primera vista.

Se ha descrito como demasiado complejo para estudiar o como una parte indiferenciada del cerebro sin organización alguna.

Eric Kandel describe la formación reticular como organizada de manera similar a la materia gris intermedia de la médula espinal.

Esta forma de organización caótica, suelta e intrincada es lo que ha impedido que muchos investigadores profundicen en esta área particular del cerebro.

Las células carecen de límites ganglionares claros, pero tienen una organización funcional clara y distintos tipos de células.

El término "formación reticular" rara vez se usa, excepto para hablar en generalidades.

Los científicos modernos generalmente se refieren a los núcleos individuales que componen la formación reticular. Moruzzi y Magoun investigaron por primera vez los componentes neuronales que regulan los mecanismos de sueño y vigilia del cerebro en 1949.

Los fisiólogos habían propuesto que alguna estructura en lo profundo del cerebro controlaba la vigilia y el estado de alerta mental.

Se pensaba que la vigilia dependía únicamente de la recepción directa de estímulos aferentes (sensoriales) en la corteza cerebral.

Como la estimulación eléctrica directa del cerebro podía simular relés electrocorticales, Magoun usó este principio para demostrar, en dos áreas separadas del tronco encefálico de un gato, cómo producir la vigilia a partir del sueño.

Primero estimuló las vías ascendentes somática y auditiva; segundo, una serie de "relevos ascendentes desde la formación reticular del tronco encefálico inferior a través del tegmento del mesencéfalo, el subtálamo y el hipotálamo hasta la cápsula interna".

Este último fue de particular interés, ya que esta serie de relés no correspondía a ninguna vía anatómica conocida para la transducción de la señal de vigilia y se acuñó como sistema de activación reticular ascendente (ARAS).

A continuación, se evaluó la importancia de este sistema de retransmisión recién identificado colocando lesiones en las porciones medial y lateral de la parte frontal del mesencéfalo.

Los gatos con interrupciones mesencefálicas del ARAS entraron en un sueño profundo y mostraron las ondas cerebrales correspondientes.

De manera alternativa, los gatos con interrupciones en las vías auditivas y somáticas ascendentes colocadas de manera similar exhibieron un sueño y una vigilia normales, y podían despertarse con estímulos físicos. 

Debido a que estos estímulos externos estarían bloqueados en su camino hacia la corteza por las interrupciones, esto indicaba que la transmisión ascendente debía viajar a través del ARAS recién descubierto.

Finalmente, Magoun registró potenciales dentro de la porción medial del tronco encefálico y descubrió que los estímulos auditivos disparaban directamente porciones del sistema de activación reticular. 

Además, la estimulación con una sola descarga del nervio ciático también activó la formación reticular medial, el hipotálamo y el tálamo. 

La excitación del ARAS no dependió de una mayor propagación de la señal a través de los circuitos del cerebelo, ya que se obtuvieron los mismos resultados después de la descerebelación y la decorticación. 

Los investigadores propusieron que una columna de células que rodea la formación reticular del mesencéfalo recibe información de todos los tractos ascendentes del tronco encefálico y transmite estos aferentes a la corteza y, por lo tanto, regula la vigilia.

FORMATION RÉTICULAIRE


La formation réticulaire est un ensemble de noyaux interconnectés situés dans tout le tronc cérébral. 

Il n'est pas anatomiquement bien défini, car il comprend des neurones situés dans différentes parties du cerveau. 

Les neurones de la formation réticulaire constituent un ensemble complexe de réseaux au cœur du tronc cérébral qui s'étendent de la partie supérieure du mésencéphale à la partie inférieure du bulbe rachidien. 

La formation réticulaire comprend des voies ascendantes vers le cortex dans le système d'activation réticulaire ascendant (ARAS) et des voies descendantes vers la moelle épinière via les voies réticulo-spinales.

Les neurones de la formation réticulaire, en particulier ceux du système d'activation réticulaire ascendant, jouent un rôle crucial dans le maintien de l'éveil comportemental et de la conscience.

Les fonctions globales de la formation réticulaire sont modulatrices et prémotrices, impliquant le contrôle moteur somatique, le contrôle cardiovasculaire, la modulation de la douleur, le sommeil et la conscience, et l'accoutumance.

Les fonctions modulatrices se trouvent principalement dans le secteur rostral de la formation réticulaire et les fonctions prémotrices sont localisées dans les neurones des régions plus caudales.

La formation réticulaire est divisée en trois colonnes : les noyaux du raphé (médian), les noyaux réticulaires gigantocellulaires (zone médiale) et les noyaux réticulaires parvocellulaires (zone latérale).

Les noyaux du raphé sont le lieu de synthèse du neurotransmetteur sérotonine, qui joue un rôle important dans la régulation de l'humeur.

Les noyaux gigantocellulaires sont impliqués dans la coordination motrice.

Les noyaux parvocellulaires régulent l'exhalation.

La formation réticulaire est essentielle pour gouverner certaines des fonctions de base des organismes supérieurs et est l'une des parties phylogénétiquement les plus anciennes du cerveau.


== Structure ==


La formation réticulaire humaine est composée de près de 100 noyaux cérébraux et contient de nombreuses projections dans le cerveau antérieur, le tronc cérébral et le cervelet, entre autres régions.

Il comprend les noyaux réticulaires, les fibres de projection réticulo-thalamiques, les projections thalamocorticales diffuses, les projections cholinergiques ascendantes, les projections non cholinergiques descendantes et les projections réticulo-spinales descendantes.

La formation réticulaire contient également deux sous-systèmes neuronaux majeurs, le système d'activation réticulaire ascendant et les voies réticulo-spinales descendantes, qui interviennent dans des processus cognitifs et physiologiques distincts.

Il a été fonctionnellement clivé à la fois sagittalement et coronairement.
Traditionnellement les noyaux réticulaires sont divisés en trois colonnes :

Dans la colonne médiane – les noyaux du raphé.

Dans la colonne médiale - noyaux gigantocellulaires (en raison de la plus grande taille des cellules).

Dans la colonne latérale - noyaux parvocellulaires (en raison de la plus petite taille des cellules).

La différenciation fonctionnelle originale était une division de caudale et rostrale.

Ceci était basé sur l'observation que la lésion de la formation réticulaire rostrale induit une hypersomnie dans le cerveau du chat. 

En revanche, la lésion de la partie la plus caudale de la formation réticulaire produit de l'insomnie chez le chat. 

Cette étude a conduit à l'idée que la partie caudale inhibe la partie rostrale de la formation réticulaire.

La division sagittale révèle davantage de distinctions morphologiques. 

Les noyaux du raphé forment une crête au milieu de la formation réticulaire et, directement à sa périphérie, il existe une division appelée formation réticulaire médiale. 

Le RF médial est large et possède de longues fibres ascendantes et descendantes, et est entouré par la formation réticulaire latérale. 

Le RF latéral est proche des noyaux moteurs des nerfs crâniens et assure principalement leur fonction.


=== Formation réticulaire médiale et latérale ===

La formation réticulaire médiale et la formation réticulaire latérale sont deux colonnes de noyaux aux limites mal définies qui envoient des projections à travers la moelle et dans le mésencéphale.

Les noyaux peuvent être différenciés par la fonction, le type de cellule et les projections des nerfs efférents ou afférents.

En se déplaçant caudalement du mésencéphale rostral, au niveau du pont rostral et du mésencéphale, le RF médial devient moins proéminent et le RF latéral devient plus proéminent.

Sur les côtés de la formation réticulaire médiale se trouve son cousin latéral, qui est particulièrement prononcé dans la moelle rostrale et le pont caudal.

De cette zone jaillissent les nerfs crâniens, y compris le très important nerf vague.

Le RF latéral est connu pour ses ganglions et ses zones d'interneurones autour des nerfs crâniens, qui servent à la médiation de leurs réflexes et fonctions caractéristiques.


== Fonction ==

La formation réticulaire se compose de plus de 100 petits réseaux de neurones, avec des fonctions variées dont les suivantes :

Contrôle moteur somatique - Certains motoneurones envoient leurs axones aux noyaux de formation réticulaire, donnant naissance aux voies réticulo-spinales de la moelle épinière.

Ces voies fonctionnent dans le maintien du tonus, de l'équilibre et de la posture, en particulier pendant les mouvements du corps.

La formation réticulaire relaie également les signaux oculaires et auditifs au cervelet afin que le cervelet puisse intégrer des stimuli visuels, auditifs et vestibulaires dans la coordination motrice.

Les autres noyaux moteurs comprennent les centres du regard, qui permettent aux yeux de suivre et de fixer des objets, et les générateurs de motifs centraux, qui produisent des signaux rythmiques de respiration et de déglutition.

Contrôle cardiovasculaire - La formation réticulaire comprend les centres cardiaques et vasomoteurs de la moelle allongée.

Modulation de la douleur - La formation réticulaire est l'un des moyens par lesquels les signaux de douleur provenant du bas du corps atteignent le cortex cérébral.

C'est aussi l'origine des voies antalgiques descendantes.

Les fibres nerveuses de ces voies agissent dans la moelle épinière pour bloquer la transmission de certains signaux de douleur au cerveau.

Sommeil et conscience - La formation réticulaire a des projections vers le thalamus et le cortex cérébral qui lui permettent d'exercer un certain contrôle sur les signaux sensoriels qui atteignent le cerveau et attirent notre attention consciente.

Il joue un rôle central dans les états de conscience comme la vigilance et le sommeil. 

Une lésion de la formation réticulaire peut entraîner un coma irréversible.

Habituation - Il s'agit d'un processus dans lequel le cerveau apprend à ignorer les stimuli répétitifs et dénués de sens tout en restant sensible aux autres. 

Un bon exemple de ceci est une personne qui peut dormir dans la circulation bruyante d'une grande ville, mais qui est réveillée rapidement en raison du son d'une alarme ou d'un bébé qui pleure. 

Les noyaux de formation réticulaire qui modulent l'activité du cortex cérébral font partie du système d'activation réticulaire ascendant.


== Principaux sous-systèmes ==

=== Système d'activation réticulaire ascendant ===


Le système d'activation réticulaire ascendant (ARAS), également connu sous le nom de système modulateur de contrôle extrathalamique ou simplement le système d'activation réticulaire (RAS), est un ensemble de noyaux connectés dans le cerveau des vertébrés qui est responsable de la régulation de l'éveil et des transitions veille-sommeil. 

L'ARAS fait partie de la formation réticulaire et est principalement composé de divers noyaux dans le thalamus et d'un certain nombre de noyaux cérébraux dopaminergiques, noradrénergiques, sérotoninergiques, histaminergiques, cholinergiques et glutamatergiques.


==== Structure de l'ARAS ====

L'ARAS est composé de plusieurs circuits neuronaux reliant la partie dorsale du mésencéphale postérieur et du pont antérieur au cortex cérébral via des voies distinctes qui se projettent à travers le thalamus et l'hypothalamus. 

L'ARAS est une collection de différents noyaux - plus de 20 de chaque côté dans le tronc cérébral supérieur, le pont, la moelle et l'hypothalamus postérieur.

Les neurotransmetteurs que ces neurones libèrent comprennent la dopamine, la noradrénaline, la sérotonine, l'histamine, l'acétylcholine et le glutamate.

Ils exercent une influence corticale par des projections axonales directes et des projections indirectes par des relais thalamiques.

La voie thalamique se compose principalement de neurones cholinergiques dans le tegmentum pontique, tandis que la voie hypothalamique est composée principalement de neurones qui libèrent des neurotransmetteurs monoamines, à savoir la dopamine, la noradrénaline, la sérotonine et l'histamine.

Les neurones libérant du glutamate dans l'ARAS ont été identifiés beaucoup plus récemment par rapport aux noyaux monoaminergiques et cholinergiques ; la composante glutamatergique de l'ARAS comprend un noyau dans l'hypothalamus et divers noyaux du tronc cérébral.

Les neurones à orexine de l'hypothalamus latéral innervent chaque composant du système d'activation réticulaire ascendant et coordonnent l'activité dans l'ensemble du système.

L'ARAS se compose d'anciennes zones évolutives du cerveau, qui sont cruciales pour la survie de l'animal et protégées pendant les périodes défavorables, comme pendant les périodes d'inhibition de Totsellreflex, alias "l'hypnose animale".

Le système activateur réticulaire ascendant qui envoie des projections neuromodulatrices au cortex - se connecte principalement au cortex préfrontal. 

Il semble y avoir une faible connectivité aux zones motrices du cortex.


==== Fonctions de l'ARAS ====


===== Conscience =====

Le système d'activation réticulaire ascendant est un important facteur permettant l'état de conscience. 

On considère que le système ascendant contribue à l'éveil caractérisé par une excitation corticale et comportementale.


===== Régulation des transitions veille-sommeil =====

La fonction principale de l'ARAS est de modifier et de potentialiser la fonction thalamique et corticale de sorte qu'une désynchronisation de l'électroencéphalogramme (EEG) s'ensuit. 

Il existe des différences distinctes dans l'activité électrique du cerveau pendant les périodes d'éveil et de sommeil : 

Les ondes cérébrales rapides à basse tension (désynchronisation EEG) sont associées à l'éveil et au sommeil paradoxal (qui sont électrophysiologiquement similaires); les ondes lentes à haute tension se trouvent pendant le sommeil non paradoxal.

D'une manière générale, lorsque les neurones relais thalamiques sont en mode rafale, l'EEG est synchronisé et lorsqu'ils sont en mode tonique, il est désynchronisé. 

La stimulation de l'ARAS produit une désynchronisation EEG en supprimant les ondes corticales lentes (0,3–1 Hz), les ondes delta (1–4 Hz) et les oscillations des ondes fusiformes (11–14 Hz) et en favorisant les oscillations de la bande gamma (20 – 40 Hz) .

Le changement physiologique d'un état de sommeil profond à l'éveil est réversible et médié par l'ARAS. 

Le noyau préoptique ventrolatéral (VLPO) de l'hypothalamus inhibe les circuits neuronaux responsables de l'état d'éveil, et l'activation du VLPO contribue à l'endormissement. 

Pendant le sommeil, les neurones de l'ARAS auront un taux de déclenchement beaucoup plus faible ; à l'inverse, ils auront un niveau d'activité plus élevé pendant l'état de veille.

Pour que le cerveau puisse dormir, il doit y avoir une réduction de l'activité afférente ascendante atteignant le cortex par suppression de l'ARAS.


===== Attention =====

L'ARAS aide également à arbitrer les transitions d'un éveil détendu à des périodes d'attention élevée.

Il y a une augmentation du flux sanguin régional (indiquant vraisemblablement une mesure accrue de l'activité neuronale) dans la formation réticulaire du mésencéphale (MRF) et les noyaux intralaminaires thalamiques pendant les tâches nécessitant une vigilance et une attention accrues.


==== Signification clinique de l'ARAS ====

Les lésions massives dans les noyaux ARAS du tronc cérébral peuvent entraîner de graves altérations du niveau de conscience (p. ex., coma).

Des lésions bilatérales de la formation réticulaire du mésencéphale peuvent entraîner le coma ou la mort.

La stimulation électrique directe de l'ARAS produit des réponses douloureuses chez les chats et suscite des rapports verbaux de douleur chez les humains.

L'activation réticulaire ascendante chez les chats peut produire une mydriase, qui peut résulter d'une douleur prolongée. 

Ces résultats suggèrent une certaine relation entre les circuits ARAS et les voies physiologiques de la douleur.


===== Pathologies =====

Certaines pathologies de l'ARAS peuvent être attribuées à l'âge, car il semble y avoir une baisse générale de la réactivité de l'ARAS avec l'âge. 

Des changements dans le couplage électrique ont été suggérés pour tenir compte de certains changements dans l'activité ARAS: si le couplage était régulé à la baisse, il y aurait une diminution correspondante de la synchronisation à haute fréquence (bande gamma). 

À l'inverse, un couplage électrique régulé augmenterait la synchronisation des rythmes rapides, ce qui pourrait entraîner une augmentation de l'éveil et de la pulsion de sommeil paradoxal. 

Plus précisément, la perturbation de l'ARAS a été impliquée dans les troubles suivants :

Narcolepsie : Des lésions le long des noyaux pédonculopontin (PPT/PPN)/tégmental latérodorsal (LDT) sont associées à la narcolepsie. 

Il existe une régulation à la baisse significative de la production de PPN et une perte de peptides d'orexine, favorisant la somnolence diurne excessive caractéristique de ce trouble.

Paralysie supranucléaire progressive (PSP) : 
Le dysfonctionnement de la signalisation du protoxyde d'azote a été impliqué dans le développement de la PSP.

Maladie de Parkinson : les troubles du sommeil paradoxal sont fréquents dans la maladie de Parkinson. 

Il s'agit principalement d'une maladie dopaminergique, mais les noyaux cholinergiques sont également épuisés. 

La dégénérescence de l'ARAS commence tôt dans le processus de la maladie.


====== Influences développementales ======

Plusieurs facteurs potentiels peuvent influencer négativement le développement du système d'activation réticulaire ascendant :

Naissance prématurée: 

Indépendamment du poids de naissance ou des semaines de gestation, la prématurité induit des effets délétères persistants sur les mécanismes pré-attentionnels (anomalies de l'éveil et veille-sommeil), attentionnels (temps de réaction et déclenchement sensoriel) et corticaux tout au long du développement.

Tabagisme pendant la grossesse : L'exposition prénatale à la fumée de cigarette est connue pour produire des déficits d'éveil, d'attention et cognitifs durables chez les humains.

Cette exposition peut induire une régulation à la hausse des récepteurs nicotiniques α4β2 sur les cellules du noyau pédonculopontin (PPN), entraînant une activité tonique accrue, un potentiel de membrane au repos et un courant cationique activé par hyperpolarisation.

Ces perturbations majeures des propriétés membranaires intrinsèques des neurones PPN entraînent une augmentation des niveaux d'excitation et de déclenchement sensoriel, des déficits (démontrés par une diminution de l'accoutumance aux stimuli auditifs répétés). 

On suppose que ces changements physiologiques peuvent intensifier la dérégulation attentionnelle plus tard dans la vie.


=== Voies réticulo-spinales descendantes ===


Les voies réticulo-spinales, également appelées voies réticulo-spinales descendantes ou antérieures, sont des voies motrices extrapyramidales qui descendent de la formation réticulaire en deux voies pour agir sur les motoneurones alimentant les fléchisseurs et extenseurs du tronc et des membres proximaux. 

Les voies réticulo-spinales sont principalement impliquées dans la locomotion et le contrôle postural, bien qu'elles aient également d'autres fonctions. 

Les voies réticulo-spinales descendantes sont l'une des quatre principales voies corticales vers la moelle épinière pour l'activité musculo-squelettique. 

Les voies réticulo-spinales fonctionnent avec les trois autres voies pour donner un contrôle coordonné du mouvement, y compris des manipulations délicates. 

Les quatre voies peuvent être regroupées en deux voies principales du système - un système médian et un système latéral. 

Le système médian comprend la voie réticulo-spinale et la voie vestibulospinale, et ce système assure le contrôle de la posture. 

Les voies corticospinales et rubrospinales appartiennent au système latéral qui assure un contrôle fin du mouvement.


==== Composants des voies réticulo-spinales ====

Ce tractus descendant est divisé en deux parties, les voies réticulo-spinales médiale (ou pontine) et latérale (ou médullaire) (MRST et LRST).

Le MRST est responsable de l'excitation des muscles extenseurs anti-gravité. 

Les fibres de ce tractus proviennent du noyau réticulaire pontique caudal et du noyau réticulaire pontique oral et se projettent vers la lamina VII et la lamina VIII de la moelle épinière.

Le LRST est responsable de l'inhibition du mouvement des muscles extenseurs axiaux excitateurs. 

Il est également responsable de la respiration automatique. 

Les fibres de ce tractus proviennent de la formation réticulaire médullaire, principalement du noyau gigantocellulaire, et descendent le long de la moelle épinière dans la partie antérieure de la colonne latérale. 

Le tractus se termine dans la lamina VII principalement avec quelques fibres se terminant dans la lamina IX de la moelle épinière.

Le tractus sensoriel ascendant véhiculant des informations dans la direction opposée est appelé tractus spinoréticulaire.


==== Fonctions des voies réticulo-spinales ====

Intègre les informations des systèmes moteurs pour coordonner les mouvements automatiques de locomotion et de posture

Facilite et inhibe les mouvements volontaires ; influence le tonus musculaire

Intervient dans les fonctions autonomes

Module les impulsions douloureuses

Influence le flux sanguin vers le noyau géniculé latéral du thalamus.


==== Signification clinique des voies réticulo-spinales ====

Les voies réticulo-spinales fournissent une voie par laquelle l'hypothalamus peut contrôler l'écoulement thoraco-lombaire sympathique et l'écoulement sacré parasympathique.

Deux systèmes descendants majeurs transportant des signaux du tronc cérébral et du cervelet vers la moelle épinière peuvent déclencher une réponse posturale automatique pour l'équilibre et l'orientation : 

les voies vestibulo-spinales des noyaux vestibulaires et les voies réticulo-spinales du pont et de la moelle. 

Les lésions de ces voies entraînent une ataxie profonde et une instabilité posturale.

Des lésions physiques ou vasculaires du tronc cérébral déconnectant le noyau rouge (mésencéphale) et les noyaux vestibulaires (pons) peuvent provoquer une rigidité décérébrée, qui a pour signe neurologique une augmentation du tonus musculaire et des réflexes d'étirement hyperactifs. 

Répondant à un stimulus surprenant ou douloureux, les bras et les jambes s'étendent et tournent intérieurement. 

La cause est l'activité tonique des voies latérales vestibulo-spinales et réticulo-spinales stimulant les motoneurones extenseurs sans les inhibitions de la voie rubrospinale.

Les lésions du tronc cérébral au-dessus du niveau du noyau rouge peuvent entraîner une rigidité de la décortication. 

Répondant à un stimulus surprenant ou douloureux, les bras fléchissent et les jambes s'étendent. 

La cause est le noyau rouge, via le tractus rubrospinal, contrecarrant l'excitation du motoneurone extenseur provenant des voies latérales vestibulospinales et réticulospinales. 

Parce que le tractus rubrospinal ne s'étend qu'à la moelle épinière cervicale, il agit principalement sur les bras en excitant les muscles fléchisseurs et en inhibant les extenseurs, plutôt que les jambes.

Les lésions de la moelle sous les noyaux vestibulaires peuvent provoquer une paralysie flasque, une hypotonie, une perte de la fonction respiratoire et une quadriplégie. 

Il n'y a pas de réflexes ressemblant aux premiers stades du choc spinal en raison de la perte complète d'activité des motoneurones, car il n'y a plus d'activité tonique provenant des voies latérales vestibulo-spinale et réticulo-spinale.


== Historique ==

Le terme «formation réticulaire» a été inventé à la fin du 19e siècle par Otto Deiters, coïncidant avec la doctrine des neurones de Ramon y Cajal. 

Allan Hobson déclare dans son livre The Reticular Formation Revisited que le nom est un vestige étymologique de l'ère déchue de la théorie des champs agrégés dans les sciences neurales.

Le terme "réticulum" signifie "structure en forme de filet", ce à quoi ressemble la formation réticulaire à première vue.

Il a été décrit comme étant soit trop complexe à étudier, soit une partie indifférenciée du cerveau sans aucune organisation.

Eric Kandel décrit la formation réticulaire comme étant organisée de manière similaire à la matière grise intermédiaire de la moelle épinière.

Cette forme d'organisation chaotique, lâche et complexe est ce qui a dissuadé de nombreux chercheurs de chercher plus loin dans cette zone particulière du cerveau.

Les cellules manquent de limites ganglionnaires claires, mais ont une organisation fonctionnelle claire et des types de cellules distincts.

Le terme "formation réticulaire" est rarement utilisé sauf pour parler en général. 

Les scientifiques modernes se réfèrent généralement aux noyaux individuels qui composent la formation réticulaire. Moruzzi et Magoun ont d'abord étudié les composants neuronaux régulant les mécanismes veille-sommeil du cerveau en 1949. 

Les physiologistes avaient proposé qu'une certaine structure profonde dans le cerveau contrôle l'éveil mental et la vigilance. 

On pensait que l'éveil ne dépendait que de la réception directe de stimuli afférents (sensoriels) au niveau du cortex cérébral.

Comme la stimulation électrique directe du cerveau pouvait simuler des relais électrocorticaux, Magoun a utilisé ce principe pour démontrer, sur deux zones distinctes du tronc cérébral d'un chat, comment produire l'éveil du sommeil. 

Il a d'abord stimulé les voies somatiques et auditives ascendantes ; deuxièmement, une série de "relais ascendants de la formation réticulaire du tronc cérébral inférieur à travers le tegmentum du mésencéphale, le sous-thalamus et l'hypothalamus jusqu'à la capsule interne".

Ce dernier était d'un intérêt particulier, car cette série de relais ne correspondait à aucune voie anatomique connue pour la transduction du signal d'éveil et a été inventée le système d'activation réticulaire ascendant (ARAS).

Ensuite, l'importance de ce système de relais nouvellement identifié a été évaluée en plaçant des lésions dans les parties médiale et latérale de l'avant du mésencéphale.

Les chats avec des interruptions mésencéphaliques de l'ARAS sont entrés dans un sommeil profond et ont affiché les ondes cérébrales correspondantes.

De manière alternative, les chats avec des interruptions placées de manière similaire aux voies auditives et somatiques ascendantes présentaient un sommeil et une éveil normaux, et pouvaient être réveillés avec des stimuli physiques.

Parce que ces stimuli externes seraient bloqués sur leur chemin vers le cortex par les interruptions, cela indiquait que la transmission ascendante devait passer par l'ARAS nouvellement découvert.

Enfin, Magoun a enregistré des potentiels dans la partie médiale du tronc cérébral et a découvert que les stimuli auditifs activaient directement des parties du système d'activation réticulaire.

De plus, la stimulation en un seul choc du nerf sciatique a également activé la formation réticulaire médiale, l'hypothalamus et le thalamus.

L'excitation de l'ARAS ne dépendait pas de la poursuite de la propagation du signal à travers les circuits cérébelleux, car les mêmes résultats étaient obtenus après décérébellation et décortication. 

Les chercheurs ont proposé qu'une colonne de cellules entourant la formation réticulaire du mésencéphale recevait des informations de toutes les voies ascendantes du tronc cérébral et relayait ces afférences au cortex et réglait ainsi l'éveil.

FORMAÇÃO RETICULAR


A formação reticular é um conjunto de núcleos interligados que estão localizados em todo o tronco encefálico. 

Não é anatomicamente bem definido, pois inclui neurônios localizados em diferentes partes do cérebro. 

Os neurônios da formação reticular formam um conjunto complexo de redes no núcleo do tronco cerebral que se estendem da parte superior do mesencéfalo até a parte inferior da medula oblonga. 

A formação reticular inclui vias ascendentes para o córtex no sistema de ativação reticular ascendente (ARAS) e vias descendentes para a medula espinhal através dos tratos reticulospinais.

Os neurônios da formação reticular, particularmente os do sistema ativador reticular ascendente, desempenham um papel crucial na manutenção da excitação comportamental e da consciência. 

As funções gerais da formação reticular são modulatórias e pré-motoras, envolvendo controle motor somático, controle cardiovascular, modulação da dor, sono e consciência e habituação. 

As funções modulatórias são encontradas principalmente no setor rostral da formação reticular e as funções pré-motoras estão localizadas nos neurônios em regiões mais caudais.

A formação reticular é dividida em três colunas: núcleos da rafe (mediana), núcleos reticulares gigantocelulares (zona medial) e núcleos reticulares parvocelulares (zona lateral).

Os núcleos da rafe são o local de síntese do neurotransmissor serotonina, que desempenha um papel importante na regulação do humor.

Os núcleos gigantocelulares estão envolvidos na coordenação motora.

Os núcleos parvocelulares regulam a expiração.

A formação reticular é essencial para governar algumas das funções básicas dos organismos superiores e é uma das porções filogeneticamente mais antigas do cérebro.


== Estrutura ==


A formação reticular humana é composta por quase 100 núcleos cerebrais e contém muitas projeções no prosencéfalo, tronco cerebral e cerebelo, entre outras regiões.

Inclui os núcleos reticulares, fibras de projeção reticulotalâmica, projeções talamocorticais difusas, projeções colinérgicas ascendentes, projeções não colinérgicas descendentes e projeções reticulospinais descendentes. 

A formação reticular também contém dois subsistemas neurais principais, o sistema ativador reticular ascendente e os tratos reticuloespinais descendentes, que medeiam processos cognitivos e fisiológicos distintos. 

Foi clivado funcionalmente tanto sagitalmente como coronalmente.
Tradicionalmente, os núcleos reticulares são divididos em três colunas:

Na coluna mediana – os núcleos da rafe.

Na coluna medial – núcleos gigantocelulares (devido ao maior tamanho das células).

Na coluna lateral – núcleos parvocelulares (devido ao menor tamanho das células).

A diferenciação funcional original era uma divisão de caudal e rostral. 

Isso foi baseado na observação de que a lesão da formação reticular rostral induz uma hipersonia no cérebro do gato. 

Em contraste, a lesão da porção mais caudal da formação reticular produz insônia em gatos. 

Este estudo levou à ideia de que a porção caudal inibe a porção rostral da formação reticular.

A divisão sagital revela mais distinções morfológicas. 

Os núcleos da rafe formam uma crista no meio da formação reticular e, diretamente para sua periferia, há uma divisão denominada formação reticular medial. 

O RF medial é grande e possui fibras ascendentes e descendentes longas e é circundado pela formação reticular lateral. 

O RF lateral está próximo aos núcleos motores dos nervos cranianos e medeia principalmente sua função.


=== Formação reticular medial e lateral ===

A formação reticular medial e a formação reticular lateral são duas colunas de núcleos com limites mal definidos que enviam projeções através da medula e para o mesencéfalo.

Os núcleos podem ser diferenciados por função, tipo de célula e projeções de nervos eferentes ou aferentes.

Movendo-se caudalmente do mesencéfalo rostral, no local da ponte rostral e do mesencéfalo, o RF medial torna-se menos proeminente e o RF lateral torna-se mais proeminente.

Existente nas laterais da formação reticular medial está sua prima lateral, que é particularmente pronunciada na medula rostral e na ponte caudal.

Desta área brotam os nervos cranianos, incluindo o muito importante nervo vago.

O RF lateral é conhecido por seus gânglios e áreas de interneurônios ao redor dos nervos cranianos, que servem para mediar seus reflexos e funções característicos.


== Função ==

A formação reticular consiste em mais de 100 pequenas redes neurais, com funções variadas, incluindo as seguintes:

Controle motor somático – Alguns neurônios motores enviam seus axônios para os núcleos de formação reticular, dando origem aos tratos reticulospinais da medula espinhal.

Esses tratos funcionam na manutenção do tônus, equilíbrio e postura – especialmente durante os movimentos do corpo.

A formação reticular também transmite sinais oculares e auditivos para o cerebelo para que o cerebelo possa integrar estímulos visuais, auditivos e vestibulares na coordenação motora.

Outros núcleos motores incluem centros de olhar, que permitem que os olhos rastreiem e fixem objetos, e geradores de padrões centrais, que produzem sinais rítmicos de respiração e deglutição.

Controle cardiovascular – A formação reticular inclui os centros cardíaco e vasomotor da medula oblonga.

Modulação da dor – A formação reticular é um meio pelo qual os sinais de dor da parte inferior do corpo atingem o córtex cerebral. 

É também a origem das vias analgésicas descendentes. 

As fibras nervosas nessas vias atuam na medula espinhal para bloquear a transmissão de alguns sinais de dor para o cérebro.

Sono e consciência – A formação reticular tem projeções para o tálamo e córtex cerebral que lhe permitem exercer algum controle sobre quais sinais sensoriais chegam ao cérebro e chegam à nossa atenção consciente. 

Desempenha um papel central em estados de consciência como alerta e sono. 

A lesão da formação reticular pode resultar em coma irreversível.

Habituação – Este é um processo no qual o cérebro aprende a ignorar estímulos repetitivos e sem sentido enquanto permanece sensível aos outros. 

Um bom exemplo disso é uma pessoa que consegue dormir em meio ao trânsito barulhento em uma cidade grande, mas é despertada prontamente devido ao som de um alarme ou choro de bebê. 

Os núcleos de formação reticular que modulam a atividade do córtex cerebral fazem parte do sistema ativador reticular ascendente.


== Subsistemas principais ==

=== Sistema de ativação reticular ascendente ===


O sistema ativador reticular ascendente (ARAS), também conhecido como sistema modulador de controle extratalâmico ou simplesmente sistema ativador reticular (RAS), é um conjunto de núcleos conectados no cérebro de vertebrados que é responsável por regular as transições vigília e sono-vigília. 

O ARAS faz parte da formação reticular e é composto principalmente de vários núcleos no tálamo e vários núcleos cerebrais dopaminérgicos, noradrenérgicos, serotoninérgicos, histaminérgicos, colinérgicos e glutamatérgicos.


==== Estrutura do ARAS ====

O ARAS é composto por vários circuitos neurais que conectam a parte dorsal do mesencéfalo posterior e a ponte anterior ao córtex cerebral por meio de vias distintas que se projetam através do tálamo e do hipotálamo. 

O ARAS é uma coleção de núcleos diferentes – mais de 20 de cada lado no tronco cerebral superior, ponte, medula e hipotálamo posterior.

Os neurotransmissores que esses neurônios liberam incluem dopamina, norepinefrina, serotonina, histamina, acetilcolina e glutamato.

Exercem influência cortical por meio de projeções axonais diretas e indiretas por meio de relés talâmicos.

A via talâmica consiste principalmente em neurônios colinérgicos no tegmento pontino, enquanto a via hipotalâmica é composta principalmente por neurônios que liberam neurotransmissores monoaminas, ou seja, dopamina, norepinefrina, serotonina e histamina.

Os neurônios liberadores de glutamato no ARAS foram identificados muito mais recentemente em relação aos núcleos monoaminérgicos e colinérgicos; o componente glutamatérgico do ARAS inclui um núcleo no hipotálamo e vários núcleos do tronco cerebral.

Os neurônios orexínicos do hipotálamo lateral inervam todos os componentes do sistema ativador reticular ascendente e coordenam a atividade em todo o sistema.

O ARAS consiste em áreas evolutivamente antigas do cérebro, que são cruciais para a sobrevivência do animal e protegidas durante períodos adversos, como durante os períodos inibitórios do Totsellreflex, também conhecido como "hipnose animal".

O sistema de ativação reticular ascendente que envia projeções neuromodulatórias para o córtex - conecta-se principalmente ao córtex pré-frontal.

Parece haver baixa conectividade com as áreas motoras do córtex.


==== Funções do ARAS ====


===== Consciência =====

O sistema ativador reticular ascendente é um importante fator de habilitação para o estado de consciência.

O sistema ascendente contribui para a vigília caracterizada pela excitação cortical e comportamental.


===== Regulando as transições sono-vigília =====

A principal função do ARAS é modificar e potencializar a função talâmica e cortical, de modo que ocorra a dessincronização do eletroencefalograma (EEG).

Existem diferenças distintas na atividade elétrica do cérebro durante os períodos de vigília e sono:

Ondas cerebrais rápidas de baixa voltagem (dessincronização do EEG) estão associadas à vigília e ao sono REM (que são eletrofisiologicamente semelhantes); ondas lentas de alta voltagem são encontradas durante o sono não REM.

De um modo geral, quando os neurônios do relé talâmico estão em modo de rajada, o EEG é sincronizado e, quando estão em modo tônico, é dessincronizado.

A estimulação do ARAS produz dessincronização do EEG suprimindo ondas corticais lentas (0,3-1 Hz), ondas delta (1-4 Hz) e oscilações de ondas fusiformes (11-14 Hz) e promovendo oscilações de banda gama (20-40 Hz) .

A mudança fisiológica de um estado de sono profundo para vigília é reversível e mediada pelo ARAS.

O núcleo pré-óptico ventrolateral (VLPO) do hipotálamo inibe os circuitos neurais responsáveis ​​pelo estado de vigília, e a ativação do VLPO contribui para o início do sono.

Durante o sono, os neurônios do ARAS terão uma taxa de disparo muito menor; inversamente, eles terão um nível de atividade mais alto durante o estado de vigília.

Para que o cérebro possa dormir, deve haver uma redução na atividade aferente ascendente que atinge o córtex por supressão do ARAS.


===== Atenção =====

O ARAS também ajuda a mediar as transições da vigília relaxada para os períodos de alta atenção. 

Há aumento do fluxo sanguíneo regional (presumivelmente indicando uma medida aumentada da atividade neuronal) na formação reticular do mesencéfalo (MRF) e nos núcleos intralaminares talâmicos durante tarefas que exigem maior atenção e alerta.


==== Significado clínico do ARAS ====

Lesões em massa nos núcleos ARAS do tronco cerebral podem causar alterações graves no nível de consciência (por exemplo, coma). 

Danos bilaterais à formação reticular do mesencéfalo podem levar ao coma ou à morte.

A estimulação elétrica direta do ARAS produz respostas de dor em gatos e provoca relatos verbais de dor em humanos. 

A ativação reticular ascendente em gatos pode produzir midríase, que pode resultar de dor prolongada. 

Esses resultados sugerem alguma relação entre os circuitos ARAS e as vias fisiológicas da dor.


===== Patologias =====

Algumas patologias do ARAS podem ser atribuídas à idade, pois parece haver um declínio geral na reatividade do ARAS com o avançar dos anos. 

Mudanças no acoplamento elétrico foram sugeridas para explicar algumas mudanças na atividade do ARAS: se o acoplamento fosse regulado negativamente, haveria uma diminuição correspondente na sincronização de alta frequência (banda gama). 

Por outro lado, o acoplamento elétrico regulado para cima aumentaria a sincronização de ritmos rápidos que poderiam levar ao aumento da excitação e do impulso do sono REM. 

Especificamente, a interrupção do ARAS tem sido implicada nos seguintes distúrbios:

Narcolepsia: Lesões ao longo dos núcleos pedunculopontino (PPT/PPN) / tegmental laterodorsal (LDT) estão associadas à narcolepsia. 

Há uma regulação negativa significativa da produção de PPN e uma perda de peptídeos de orexina, promovendo a sonolência diurna excessiva que é característica desse distúrbio.

Paralisia supranuclear progressiva (PSP): 
A disfunção da sinalização do óxido nitroso tem sido implicada no desenvolvimento da PSP.

Doença de Parkinson: distúrbios do sono REM são comuns na doença de Parkinson. 

É principalmente uma doença dopaminérgica, mas os núcleos colinérgicos também estão esgotados. 

A degeneração no ARAS começa no início do processo da doença.


====== Influências do desenvolvimento ======

Existem vários fatores potenciais que podem influenciar negativamente o desenvolvimento do sistema ativador reticular ascendente:

Nascimento prematuro: 

Independentemente do peso ao nascer ou semanas de gestação, o nascimento prematuro induz efeitos deletérios persistentes nos mecanismos pré-atencionais (anormalidades do despertar e sono-vigília), atencionais (tempo de reação e ativação sensorial) e nos mecanismos corticais ao longo do desenvolvimento.

Fumar durante a gravidez: Sabe-se que a exposição pré-natal à fumaça do cigarro produz excitação duradoura, déficits de atenção e cognitivos em humanos. 

Essa exposição pode induzir a suprarregulação dos receptores nicotínicos α4β2 nas células do núcleo pedunculopontino (PPN), resultando em aumento da atividade tônica, potencial de repouso da membrana e corrente catiônica ativada por hiperpolarização. 

Esses principais distúrbios das propriedades intrínsecas da membrana dos neurônios da PPN resultam em níveis aumentados de excitação e bloqueio sensorial, déficits (demonstrados por uma quantidade diminuída de habituação a estímulos auditivos repetidos).

Supõe-se que essas mudanças fisiológicas podem intensificar a desregulação da atenção mais tarde na vida.


=== Tratos reticulospinais descendentes ===


Os tratos reticulospinais, também conhecidos como tratos reticulospinais descendentes ou anteriores, são tratos motores extrapiramidais que descem da formação reticular em dois tratos para atuar nos neurônios motores que suprem os flexores e extensores do tronco e membros proximais.

Os tratos reticulospinais estão envolvidos principalmente na locomoção e no controle postural, embora também tenham outras funções.

Os tratos reticulospinais descendentes são uma das quatro principais vias corticais para a medula espinhal para a atividade musculoesquelética. 

Os tratos reticulospinais trabalham com as outras três vias para dar um controle coordenado do movimento, incluindo manipulações delicadas. 

As quatro vias podem ser agrupadas em duas vias principais do sistema – um sistema medial e um sistema lateral. 

O sistema medial inclui a via reticuloespinhal e a via vestíbuloespinhal, e esse sistema fornece controle da postura. 

As vias do trato corticoespinhal e rubroespinhal pertencem ao sistema lateral que fornece controle preciso do movimento.


==== Componentes dos tratos reticulospinais ====

Este trato descendente é dividido em duas partes, os tratos reticulospinais medial (ou pontino) e lateral (ou medular) (MRST e LRST).

O MRST é responsável por excitar os músculos extensores antigravitacionais.

As fibras desse trato originam-se do núcleo reticular pontino caudal e do núcleo reticular pontino oral e se projetam para a lâmina VII e a lâmina VIII da medula espinhal.

O LRST é responsável por inibir o movimento dos músculos extensores axiais excitatórios.

Também é responsável pela respiração automática.

As fibras desse trato surgem da formação reticular medular, principalmente do núcleo gigantocelular, e descem ao longo da medula espinhal na parte anterior da coluna lateral.

O trato termina na lâmina VII principalmente com algumas fibras terminando na lâmina IX da medula espinhal.

O trato sensorial ascendente que transmite informações na direção oposta é conhecido como trato espinorreticular.


==== Funções dos tratos reticulospinais ====

Integra informações dos sistemas motores para coordenar movimentos automáticos de locomoção e postura

Facilita e inibe o movimento voluntário; influencia o tônus ​​muscular

Media funções autônomas

Modula os impulsos de dor

Influencia o fluxo sanguíneo para o núcleo geniculado lateral do tálamo.


==== Significado clínico dos tratos reticulospinais ====

Os tratos reticulospinais fornecem uma via pela qual o hipotálamo pode controlar a saída toracolombar simpática e a saída sacral parassimpática.

Dois principais sistemas descendentes que transportam sinais do tronco cerebral e cerebelo para a medula espinhal podem desencadear uma resposta postural automática para equilíbrio e orientação: 

tratos vestibuloespinais dos núcleos vestibulares e tratos reticulospinais da ponte e medula. 

As lesões desses tratos resultam em profunda ataxia e instabilidade postural.

Danos físicos ou vasculares ao tronco encefálico desconectando o núcleo vermelho (mesencéfalo) e os núcleos vestibulares (ponte) podem causar rigidez descerebrada, que tem o sinal neurológico de aumento do tônus ​​muscular e reflexos de estiramento hiperativos. 

Respondendo a um estímulo surpreendente ou doloroso, ambos os braços e pernas se estendem e giram internamente. 

A causa é a atividade tônica dos tratos vestibuloespinal lateral e reticuloespinhal estimulando os motoneurônios extensores sem as inibições do trato rubroespinhal.

Danos no tronco cerebral acima do nível do núcleo vermelho podem causar rigidez decorticada. 

Respondendo a um estímulo surpreendente ou doloroso, os braços flexionam e as pernas se estendem. 

A causa é o núcleo rubro, através do trato rubroespinhal, neutralizando a excitação do neurônio motor extensor dos tratos vestibuloespinal lateral e reticuloespinhal. 

Como o trato rubroespinhal se estende apenas até a medula espinhal cervical, ele atua principalmente nos braços, excitando os músculos flexores e inibindo os extensores, em vez das pernas.

Danos à medula abaixo dos núcleos vestibulares podem causar paralisia flácida, hipotonia, perda do impulso respiratório e tetraplegia. 

Não há reflexos semelhantes aos estágios iniciais do choque espinhal devido à perda completa da atividade dos neurônios motores, pois não há mais atividade tônica proveniente dos tratos vestibuloespinal lateral e reticuloespinhal.


== História ==

O termo "formação reticular" foi cunhado no final do século 19 por Otto Deiters, coincidindo com a doutrina do neurônio de Ramon y Cajal. 

Allan Hobson afirma em seu livro The Reticular Formation Revisited que o nome é um vestígio etimológico da era caída da teoria do campo agregado nas ciências neurais.

O termo "retículo" significa "estrutura em forma de rede", que é o que a formação reticular se assemelha à primeira vista.

Foi descrito como sendo muito complexo para estudar ou uma parte indiferenciada do cérebro sem organização alguma.

Eric Kandel descreve a formação reticular como sendo organizada de maneira semelhante à substância cinzenta intermediária da medula espinhal.

Essa forma de organização caótica, frouxa e intrincada é o que tem impedido muitos pesquisadores de olhar mais longe nessa área específica do cérebro.

As células não possuem limites ganglionares claros, mas têm organização funcional clara e tipos celulares distintos.

O termo "formação reticular" raramente é mais usado, exceto para falar em generalidades. 

Os cientistas modernos geralmente se referem aos núcleos individuais que compõem a formação reticular. Moruzzi e Magoun investigaram pela primeira vez os componentes neurais que regulam os mecanismos de sono-vigília do cérebro em 1949. 

Os fisiologistas propuseram que alguma estrutura profunda dentro do cérebro controlava a vigília mental e o estado de alerta. 

Pensava-se que a vigília dependia apenas da recepção direta de estímulos aferentes (sensoriais) no córtex cerebral.

Como a estimulação elétrica direta do cérebro pode simular relés eletrocorticais, Magoun usou esse princípio para demonstrar, em duas áreas separadas do tronco cerebral de um gato, como produzir vigília a partir do sono. 

Ele primeiro estimulou as vias somáticas e auditivas ascendentes; segundo, uma série de "relês ascendentes da formação reticular do tronco cerebral inferior através do tegmento do mesencéfalo, subtálamo e hipotálamo até a cápsula interna".

Este último foi de particular interesse, pois essa série de relés não correspondia a nenhuma via anatômica conhecida para a transdução do sinal de vigília e foi denominada sistema de ativação reticular ascendente (ARAS).

Em seguida, a significância deste sistema de retransmissão recém-identificado foi avaliada pela colocação de lesões nas porções medial e lateral da frente do mesencéfalo.

Gatos com interrupções mesencefálicas do ARAS entraram em sono profundo e exibiram ondas cerebrais correspondentes.

De forma alternativa, os gatos com interrupções nas vias auditivas e somáticas ascendentes apresentaram sono e vigília normais e podem ser despertados com estímulos físicos. 

Como esses estímulos externos seriam bloqueados em seu caminho para o córtex pelas interrupções, isso indicava que a transmissão ascendente deve viajar através do ARAS recém-descoberto.

Finalmente, Magoun registrou potenciais na porção medial do tronco cerebral e descobriu que estímulos auditivos disparavam diretamente porções do sistema ativador reticular. 

Além disso, a estimulação de choque único do nervo ciático também ativou a formação reticular medial, hipotálamo e tálamo. 

A excitação do ARAS não dependeu de mais propagação do sinal através dos circuitos cerebelares, pois os mesmos resultados foram obtidos após decerebelação e decorticação. 

Os pesquisadores propuseram que uma coluna de células ao redor da formação reticular do mesencéfalo recebia informações de todos os tratos ascendentes do tronco cerebral e retransmitia essas aferências para o córtex e, portanto, regulava a vigília.
