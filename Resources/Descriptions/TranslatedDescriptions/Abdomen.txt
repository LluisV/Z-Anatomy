ABDOMEN


The abdomen (colloquially called the belly, tummy, midriff, stomach, tucky or stocham) is the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. 

The abdomen is the front part of the abdominal segment of the torso. 

The area occupied by the abdomen is called the abdominal cavity. 

In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax.

In humans, the abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. 

The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. 

The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. 

The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear.

In vertebrates, the abdomen is a large body cavity enclosed by the abdominal muscles, at front and to the sides, and by part of the vertebral column at the back. 

Lower ribs can also enclose ventral and lateral walls. 

The abdominal cavity is continuous with, and above, the pelvic cavity. 

It is attached to the thoracic cavity by the diaphragm. 

Structures such as the aorta, inferior vena cava and esophagus pass through the diaphragm. 

Both the abdominal and pelvic cavities are lined by a serous membrane known as the parietal peritoneum. 

This membrane is continuous with the visceral peritoneum lining the organs. 

The abdomen in vertebrates contains a number of organs belonging to, for instance, the digestive system, urinary system, and muscular system.


== Contents ==


The abdominal cavity contains most organs of the digestive system, including the stomach, the small intestine, and the colon with its attached appendix. 

Other digestive organs are known as the accessory digestive organs and include the liver, its attached gallbladder, and the pancreas, and these communicate with the rest of the system via various ducts. 

The spleen, and organs of the urinary system including the kidneys, and adrenal glands also lie within the abdomen, along with many blood vessels including the aorta and inferior vena cava. 

The urinary bladder, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries may be seen as either abdominal organs or as pelvic organs. 

Finally, the abdomen contains an extensive membrane called the peritoneum. 

A fold of peritoneum may completely cover certain organs, whereas it may cover only one side of organs that usually lie closer to the abdominal wall. 

This is called the retroperitoneum, and the kidneys and ureters are known as retroperitoneal organs.
Abdominal organs can be highly specialized in some animals. 

For example, the stomach of ruminants, (a suborder of mammals that includes cattle and sheep), is divided into four chambers – rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum.

		


== Muscles ==


There are three layers of muscles in the abdominal wall. 

They are, from the outside to the inside: external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse abdominal. 

The first three layers extend between the vertebral column, the lower ribs, the iliac crest and pubis of the hip. 

All of their fibers merge towards the midline and surround the rectus abdominis in a sheath before joining up on the opposite side at the linea alba. 

Strength is gained by the criss-crossing of fibers, such that the external oblique runs downward and forward, the internal oblique upward and forward, and the transverse abdominal horizontally forward.

The transverse abdominal muscle is flat and triangular, with its fibers running horizontally. 

It lies between the internal oblique and the underlying transverse fascia. 

It originates from the inguinal ligament, costal cartilages 7-12, the iliac crest and thoracolumbar fascia. 

Inserts into the conjoint tendon, xiphoid process, linea alba and the pubic crest.
The rectus abdominis muscles are long and flat. 

The muscle is crossed by three fibrous bands called the tendinous intersections. 

The rectus abdominis is enclosed in a thick sheath, formed as described above, by fibers from each of the three muscles of the lateral abdominal wall. 

They originate at the pubis bone, run up the abdomen on either side of the linea alba, and insert into the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs. 

In the region of the groin, the inguinal canal, is a passage through the layers. 

This gap is where the testes can drop through the wall and where the fibrous cord from the uterus in the female runs. 

This is also where weakness can form, and cause inguinal hernias.The pyramidalis muscle is small and triangular. 

It is located in the lower abdomen in front of the rectus abdominis. 

It originates at the pubic bone and is inserted into the linea alba halfway up to the navel.


== Function ==


Functionally, the human abdomen is where most of the digestive tract is placed and so most of the absorption and digestion of food occurs here. 

The alimentary tract in the abdomen consists of the lower esophagus, the stomach, the duodenum, the jejunum, ileum, the cecum and the appendix, the ascending, transverse and descending colons, the sigmoid colon and the rectum. 

Other vital organs inside the abdomen include the liver, the kidneys, the pancreas and the spleen.

The abdominal wall is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides), and anterior (front) walls.


=== Movement, breathing and other functions ===

The abdominal muscles have different important functions. 

They assist as muscles of exhalation in the breathing process during forceful exhalation. 

Moreover, these muscles serve as protection for the inner organs. 

Furthermore, together with the back muscles they provide postural support and are important in defining the form. 

When the glottis is closed and the thorax and pelvis are fixed, they are integral in the cough, urination, defecation, childbirth, vomit, and singing functions. 

When the pelvis is fixed, they can initiate the movement of the trunk in a forward motion. 

They also prevent hyperextension. 

When the thorax is fixed, they can pull up the pelvis and finally, they can bend the vertebral column sideways and assist in the trunk's rotation.


=== Posture ===

The transverse abdominis muscle is the deepest muscle, therefore, it cannot be touched from the outside. 

It can greatly affect the body's posture. 

The internal obliques are also deep and also affect body posture. 

Both of them are involved in rotation and lateral flexion of the spine and are used to bend and support the spine from the front. 

The external obliques are more superficial and they are also involved in rotation and lateral flexion of the spine. 

Also they stabilize the spine when upright. 

The rectus abdominis muscle is not the most superficial abdominal muscle. 

The tendonous sheath extending from the external obliques cover the rectus abdominis. 

The rectus abdominis is the muscle that very fit people develop into the 6-pack ab look. 

Although it should really be a 10 pack as there are 5 vertical sections on each side. 

The 2 bottom sections are just above the pubic bone and usually not visible, hence, the 6 pack abs. 

The rectus abdominals' function is to bend one's back forward (flexion). 

The main work of the abdominal muscles is to bend the spine forward when contracting concentrically.


== Society and culture ==


Social and cultural perceptions of the outward appearance of the abdomen has varying significance around the world. 

Depending on the type of society, excess weight can be perceived as an indicator of wealth and prestige due to excess food, or as a sign of poor health due to lack of exercise. 

In many cultures, bare abdomens are distinctly sexualized and perceived similarly to breast cleavage.


== Exercise ==

Being key elements of spinal support, and contributors to good posture, it is important to properly exercise the abdominal muscles together with the back muscles because when these are weak or overly tight they can suffer painful spasms and injuries. 

When properly exercised, abdominal muscles contribute to improved posture and balance, reduce the likelihood of back pain episodes, reduce the severity of back pain, protect against injury by responding efficiently to stresses, help avoid some back surgeries, and help with the healing of back problems, or after spine surgery. 

When strengthened, the abdominal muscles provide flexibility as well. 

The abdominal muscles can be worked by practicing disciplines of general body strength such as Pilates, yoga, T'ai chi, and jogging. 

There are also specific routines which target each of these muscles.


== Clinical significance ==

Abdominal obesity is a condition where abdominal fat or visceral fat, has built up excessively between the abdominal organs. 

This is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, asthma and type 2 diabetes.

Abdominal trauma is an injury to the abdomen and can involve damage to the abdominal organs. 

There is an associated risk of severe blood loss and infection. 

Injury to the lower chest can cause injuries to the spleen and liver.A scaphoid abdomen is when the abdomen is sucked inwards. 

In a newborn, it may represent a diaphragmatic hernia. 

In general, it is indicative of malnutrition.


=== Disease ===


Many gastrointestinal diseases affect the abdominal organs. 

These include stomach disease, liver disease, pancreatic disease, gallbladder and bile duct disease; intestinal diseases include enteritis, coeliac disease, diverticulitis, and IBS.


=== Examination ===

Different medical procedures can be used to examine the organs of the gastrointestinal tract. 

These include endoscopy, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, enteroscopy, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and virtual colonoscopy. 

There are also a number of medical imaging techniques that can be used. 

Surface landmarks are important in the examination of the abdomen.


==== Surface landmarks ====

In the mid-line a slight furrow extends from the xiphoid process above to the pubic symphysis below, representing the linea alba in the abdominal wall. 

At about its midpoint sits the umbilicus or navel. 

The rectus abdominis on each side of the linea alba stands out in muscular people. 

The outline of these muscles is interrupted by three or more transverse depressions indicating the tendinous intersections. 

There is usually one about the xiphoid process, one at the navel, and one in between. 

It is the combination of the linea alba and the tendinous intersections which form the abdominal "six-pack" sought after by many people.

The upper lateral limit of the abdomen is the subcostal margin (at or near the subcostal plane) formed by the cartilages of the false ribs (8, 9, 10) joining one another. 

The lower lateral limit is the anterior crest of the ilium and Poupart's ligament, which runs from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the pubis. 

These lower limits are marked by visible grooves. 

Just above the pubic spines on either side are the external abdominal rings, which are openings in the muscular wall of the abdomen through which the spermatic cord emerges in the male, and through which an inguinal hernia may rupture.

One method by which the location of the abdominal contents can be appreciated is to draw three horizontal and two vertical lines.


===== Horizontal lines =====

The highest of the former is the transpyloric line of C. 

Addison, which is situated halfway between the suprasternal notch and the top of the pubic symphysis, and often cuts the pyloric opening of the stomach an inch to the right of the mid-line. 

The hilum of each kidney is a little below it, while its left end approximately touches the lower limit of the spleen. 

It corresponds to the first lumbar vertebra behind.
The second line is the subcostal line, drawn from the lowest point of the subcostal arch (tenth rib). 

It corresponds to the upper part of the third lumbar vertebra, and it is an inch or so above the umbilicus. 

It indicates roughly the transverse colon, the lower ends of the kidneys, and the upper limit of the transverse (3rd) part of the duodenum.

The third line is called the intertubercular line, and runs across between the two rough tubercles, which can be felt on the outer lip of the crest of the ilium about two and a half inches (64 mm) from the anterior superior spine. 

This line corresponds to the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and passes through or just above the ileo-caecal valve, where the small intestine joins the large intestine.


===== Vertical lines =====

The two vertical or mid-Poupart lines are drawn from the point midway between the anterior superior spine and the pubic symphysis on each side, vertically upward to the costal margin.

The right one is the most valuable, as the ileo-caecal valve is situated where it cuts the intertubercular line. 

The orifice of the appendix lies an inch lower, at McBurney's point. 

In its upper part, the vertical line meets the transpyloric line at the lower margin of the ribs, usually the ninth, and here the gallbladder is situated.

The left mid-Poupart line corresponds in its upper three-quarters to the inner edge of the descending colon.The right subcostal margin corresponds to the lower limit of the liver, while the right nipple is about half an inch above its upper limit.


=== Quadrants and regions ===


The abdomen can be divided into quadrants or regions to describe the location of an organ or structure. 

Classically, quadrants are described as the left upper, left lower, right upper, and right lower. 

Quadrants are also often used in describing the site of an abdominal pain.The abdomen can also be divided into nine regions. 

These terms stem from "hypo" meaning "below" and "epi" means "above", while "chondron" means "cartilage" (in this case, the cartilage of the rib) and "gaster" means stomach. 

The reversal of "left" and "right" is intentional, because the anatomical designations reflect the patient's own right and left.)
The "right iliac fossa" (RIF) is a common site of pain and tenderness in patients who have appendicitis. 

The fossa is named for the underlying iliac fossa of the hip bone, and thus is somewhat imprecise. 

Most of the anatomical structures that will produce pain and tenderness in this region are not in fact in the concavity of the ileum. 

However, the term is in common usage.


== Other animals ==


In arthropods the abdomen is built up of a series of upper plates known as tergites and lower plates known as sternites, the whole being held together by a tough yet stretchable membrane.
The abdomen contains the insect's digestive tract and reproductive organs, it consists of eleven segments in most orders of insects though the eleventh segment is absent in the adult of most higher orders. 

The number of these segments does vary from species to species with the number of segments visible reduced to only seven in the common honeybee. 

In the Collembola (Springtails) the abdomen has only six segments.
The abdomen is sometimes highly modified. 

In Apocrita (bees, ants and wasps), the first segment of the abdomen is fused to the thorax and is called the propodeum. 

In ants the second segment forms the narrow petiole. 

Some ants have an additional postpetiole segment, and the remaining segments form the bulbous gaster. 

The petiole and gaster (abdominal segments 2 and onward) are collectively called the metasoma.
Unlike other arthropods, insects possess no legs on the abdomen in adult form, though the Protura do have rudimentary leg-like appendages on the first three abdominal segments, and Archaeognatha possess small, articulated "styli" which are sometimes considered to be rudimentary appendages. 

Many larval insects including the Lepidoptera and the Symphyta (Sawflies) have fleshy appendages called prolegs on their abdominal segments (as well as their more familiar thoracic legs), which allow them to grip onto the edges of plant leaves as they walk around.
In arachnids (spiders, scorpions and relatives), the term "abdomen" is used interchangeably with "opisthosoma" ("hind body"), which is the body section posterior to that bearing the legs and head (the prosoma or cephalothorax).

ABDOMEN


El abdomen (coloquialmente llamado vientre, barriga, diafragma, estómago, tucky o stocham) es la parte del cuerpo entre el tórax (pecho) y la pelvis, en humanos y en otros vertebrados.

El abdomen es la parte frontal del segmento abdominal del torso.

El área ocupada por el abdomen se llama cavidad abdominal.

En los artrópodos es el tagma posterior del cuerpo; sigue al tórax o cefalotórax.

En los humanos, el abdomen se extiende desde el tórax en el diafragma torácico hasta la pelvis en el borde pélvico.

El borde pélvico se extiende desde la articulación lumbosacra (el disco intervertebral entre L5 y S1) hasta la sínfisis púbica y es el borde de la entrada pélvica.

El espacio por encima de esta entrada y por debajo del diafragma torácico se denomina cavidad abdominal.

El límite de la cavidad abdominal es la pared abdominal por delante y la superficie peritoneal por detrás.

En los vertebrados, el abdomen es una gran cavidad corporal encerrada por los músculos abdominales, al frente y a los lados, y por parte de la columna vertebral en la parte posterior.

Las costillas inferiores también pueden encerrar paredes ventrales y laterales.

La cavidad abdominal se continúa con y por encima de la cavidad pélvica.

Está unido a la cavidad torácica por el diafragma.

Estructuras como la aorta, la vena cava inferior y el esófago pasan a través del diafragma.

Tanto la cavidad abdominal como la pélvica están revestidas por una membrana serosa conocida como peritoneo parietal.

Esta membrana se continúa con el peritoneo visceral que recubre los órganos.

El abdomen de los vertebrados contiene una serie de órganos que pertenecen, por ejemplo, al sistema digestivo, al sistema urinario y al sistema muscular.


== Contenidos ==


La cavidad abdominal contiene la mayoría de los órganos del sistema digestivo, incluidos el estómago, el intestino delgado y el colon con su apéndice adjunto.

Otros órganos digestivos se conocen como órganos digestivos accesorios e incluyen el hígado, su vesícula biliar adjunta y el páncreas, y estos se comunican con el resto del sistema a través de varios conductos.

El bazo y los órganos del sistema urinario, incluidos los riñones, y las glándulas suprarrenales también se encuentran dentro del abdomen, junto con muchos vasos sanguíneos, incluidas la aorta y la vena cava inferior.

La vejiga urinaria, el útero, las trompas de Falopio y los ovarios pueden verse como órganos abdominales o como órganos pélvicos.

Finalmente, el abdomen contiene una membrana extensa llamada peritoneo.

Un pliegue de peritoneo puede cubrir completamente ciertos órganos, mientras que puede cubrir solo un lado de los órganos que generalmente se encuentran más cerca de la pared abdominal.

Esto se llama retroperitoneo, y los riñones y los uréteres se conocen como órganos retroperitoneales.
Los órganos abdominales pueden estar altamente especializados en algunos animales.

Por ejemplo, el estómago de los rumiantes (un suborden de mamíferos que incluye bovinos y ovinos) se divide en cuatro cámaras: rumen, retículo, omaso y abomaso.

 


== Músculos ==


Hay tres capas de músculos en la pared abdominal.

Son, de fuera hacia dentro: oblicuo externo, oblicuo interno y transverso abdominal.

Las tres primeras capas se extienden entre la columna vertebral, las costillas inferiores, la cresta ilíaca y el pubis de la cadera.

Todas sus fibras se fusionan hacia la línea media y rodean el recto abdominal en una vaina antes de unirse en el lado opuesto en la línea alba.

La fuerza se obtiene mediante el entrecruzamiento de las fibras, de modo que el oblicuo externo corre hacia abajo y hacia adelante, el oblicuo interno hacia arriba y hacia adelante, y el transverso abdominal horizontalmente hacia adelante.

El músculo abdominal transverso es plano y triangular, con sus fibras discurriendo horizontalmente.

Se encuentra entre el oblicuo interno y la fascia transversa subyacente.

Se origina en el ligamento inguinal, los cartílagos costales 7-12, la cresta ilíaca y la fascia toracolumbar.

Se inserta en el tendón conjunto, el proceso xifoides, la línea alba y la cresta púbica.
Los músculos rectos del abdomen son largos y planos.

El músculo está atravesado por tres bandas fibrosas llamadas intersecciones tendinosas.

El recto abdominal está encerrado en una vaina gruesa, formada como se describió anteriormente, por fibras de cada uno de los tres músculos de la pared abdominal lateral.

Se originan en el hueso del pubis, suben por el abdomen a ambos lados de la línea alba y se insertan en los cartílagos de las costillas quinta, sexta y séptima.

En la región de la ingle, el canal inguinal, es un pasaje a través de las capas.

Este espacio es donde los testículos pueden caer a través de la pared y donde corre el cordón fibroso del útero en la hembra.

Aquí también es donde se puede formar debilidad y causar hernias inguinales. El músculo piramidal es pequeño y triangular.

Se encuentra en la parte inferior del abdomen frente al recto abdominal.

Se origina en el hueso púbico y se inserta en la línea alba hasta la mitad del ombligo.


== Función ==


Funcionalmente, el abdomen humano es donde se coloca la mayor parte del tracto digestivo y, por lo tanto, la mayor parte de la absorción y digestión de los alimentos ocurre aquí.

El tubo digestivo en el abdomen consta del esófago inferior, el estómago, el duodeno, el yeyuno, el íleon, el ciego y el apéndice, los dos puntos ascendente, transverso y descendente, el colon sigmoide y el recto.

Otros órganos vitales dentro del abdomen incluyen el hígado, los riñones, el páncreas y el bazo.

La pared abdominal se divide en las paredes posterior (espalda), lateral (lados) y anterior (frontal).


=== Movimiento, respiración y otras funciones ===

Los músculos abdominales tienen diferentes funciones importantes.

Ayudan como músculos de exhalación en el proceso de respiración durante la exhalación forzada.

Además, estos músculos sirven como protección para los órganos internos.

Además, junto con los músculos de la espalda, proporcionan soporte postural y son importantes para definir la forma.

Cuando la glotis está cerrada y el tórax y la pelvis están fijos, son parte integral de las funciones de tos, micción, defecación, parto, vómito y canto.

Cuando la pelvis está fija, pueden iniciar el movimiento del tronco hacia adelante.

También previenen la hiperextensión.

Cuando el tórax está fijo, pueden levantar la pelvis y, finalmente, pueden doblar la columna vertebral hacia los lados y ayudar en la rotación del tronco.


=== Postura ===

El músculo transverso del abdomen es el músculo más profundo, por lo tanto, no se puede tocar desde el exterior.

Puede afectar en gran medida la postura del cuerpo.

Los oblicuos internos también son profundos y también afectan la postura del cuerpo.

Ambos están involucrados en la rotación y flexión lateral de la columna vertebral y se utilizan para doblar y sostener la columna desde el frente.

Los oblicuos externos son más superficiales y también participan en la rotación y flexión lateral de la columna.

También estabilizan la columna cuando están erguidos.

El músculo recto del abdomen no es el músculo abdominal más superficial.

La vaina tendinosa que se extiende desde los oblicuos externos cubre el recto abdominal.

El rectus abdominis es el músculo que las personas muy en forma desarrollan en el look abdominal de 6 paquetes.

Aunque en realidad debería ser un paquete de 10 ya que hay 5 secciones verticales en cada lado.

Las 2 secciones inferiores están justo encima del hueso púbico y generalmente no son visibles, por lo tanto, los abdominales de 6 paquetes.

La función de los rectos abdominales es doblar la espalda hacia adelante (flexión).

El trabajo principal de los músculos abdominales es doblar la columna hacia adelante cuando se contrae concéntricamente.


== Sociedad y cultura ==


Las percepciones sociales y culturales de la apariencia externa del abdomen tienen un significado variable en todo el mundo.

Según el tipo de sociedad, el exceso de peso puede percibirse como un indicador de riqueza y prestigio debido al exceso de alimentación, o como un signo de mala salud por falta de ejercicio.

En muchas culturas, los abdómenes desnudos se sexualizan claramente y se perciben de manera similar al escote de los senos.


== Ejercicio ==

Al ser elementos clave del soporte de la columna y contribuyentes a una buena postura, es importante ejercitar adecuadamente los músculos abdominales junto con los músculos de la espalda porque cuando estos están débiles o demasiado tensos pueden sufrir espasmos dolorosos y lesiones.

Cuando se ejercitan adecuadamente, los músculos abdominales contribuyen a mejorar la postura y el equilibrio, reducen la probabilidad de episodios de dolor de espalda, reducen la gravedad del dolor de espalda, protegen contra lesiones respondiendo de manera eficiente al estrés, ayudan a evitar algunas cirugías de espalda y ayudan con la curación de la espalda. o después de una cirugía de columna.

Cuando se fortalecen, los músculos abdominales también brindan flexibilidad.

Los músculos abdominales se pueden trabajar practicando disciplinas de fuerza general del cuerpo como Pilates, yoga, T'ai chi y jogging.

También hay rutinas específicas que se enfocan en cada uno de estos músculos.


== Importancia clínica ==

La obesidad abdominal es una condición en la que la grasa abdominal o grasa visceral se ha acumulado en exceso entre los órganos abdominales.

Esto se asocia con un mayor riesgo de enfermedad cardíaca, asma y diabetes tipo 2.

El traumatismo abdominal es una lesión en el abdomen y puede implicar daños en los órganos abdominales.

Existe un riesgo asociado de pérdida severa de sangre e infección.

Una lesión en la parte inferior del tórax puede causar lesiones en el bazo y el hígado. Un abdomen escafoides es cuando el abdomen se succiona hacia adentro.

En un recién nacido, puede representar una hernia diafragmática.

En general, es indicativo de desnutrición.


=== Enfermedad ===


Muchas enfermedades gastrointestinales afectan los órganos abdominales.

Estos incluyen enfermedad estomacal, enfermedad hepática, enfermedad pancreática, enfermedad de la vesícula biliar y del conducto biliar; las enfermedades intestinales incluyen enteritis, enfermedad celíaca, diverticulitis y SII.


=== Examen ===

Se pueden usar diferentes procedimientos médicos para examinar los órganos del tracto gastrointestinal.

Estos incluyen endoscopia, colonoscopia, sigmoidoscopia, enteroscopia, esofagogastroduodenoscopia y colonoscopia virtual.

También hay una serie de técnicas de imágenes médicas que se pueden utilizar.

Los puntos de referencia superficiales son importantes en el examen del abdomen.


==== Puntos de referencia de la superficie ====

En la línea media, un ligero surco se extiende desde el proceso xifoides por encima hasta la sínfisis púbica por debajo, lo que representa la línea alba en la pared abdominal.

Aproximadamente en su punto medio se encuentra el ombligo u ombligo.

El rectus abdominis a cada lado de la linea alba se destaca en personas musculosas.

El contorno de estos músculos está interrumpido por tres o más depresiones transversales que indican las intersecciones tendinosas.

Por lo general, hay uno sobre el proceso xifoides, uno en el ombligo y uno en el medio.

Es la combinación de la línea alba y las intersecciones tendinosas lo que forma el "six-pack" abdominal buscado por muchas personas.

El límite lateral superior del abdomen es el margen subcostal (en o cerca del plano subcostal) formado por los cartílagos de las falsas costillas (8, 9, 10) que se unen entre sí.

El límite lateral inferior es la cresta anterior del ilion y el ligamento de Poupart, que va desde la espina anterosuperior del ilion hasta la espina del pubis.

Estos límites inferiores están marcados por surcos visibles.

Justo encima de las espinas púbicas a ambos lados se encuentran los anillos abdominales externos, que son aberturas en la pared muscular del abdomen a través de las cuales emerge el cordón espermático en el varón y a través de las cuales se puede romper una hernia inguinal.

Un método por el cual se puede apreciar la ubicación del contenido abdominal es dibujar tres líneas horizontales y dos verticales.


===== Líneas horizontales =====

La más alta de las primeras es la línea transpilórica de C.

Addison, que está situada a mitad de camino entre la muesca supraesternal y la parte superior de la sínfisis púbica, y a menudo corta la abertura pilórica del estómago una pulgada a la derecha de la línea media.

El hilio de cada riñón está un poco por debajo de él, mientras que su extremo izquierdo toca aproximadamente el límite inferior del bazo.

Corresponde a la primera vértebra lumbar por detrás.
La segunda línea es la línea subcostal, trazada desde el punto más bajo del arco subcostal (décima costilla).

Corresponde a la parte superior de la tercera vértebra lumbar, y está aproximadamente una pulgada por encima del ombligo.

Indica aproximadamente el colon transverso, los extremos inferiores de los riñones y el límite superior de la parte transversa (tercera) del duodeno.

La tercera línea se llama línea intertubercular y atraviesa los dos tubérculos rugosos, que se pueden sentir en el borde exterior de la cresta del ilion a unas dos pulgadas y media (64 mm) de la espina anterosuperior.

Esta línea corresponde al cuerpo de la quinta vértebra lumbar y pasa a través o justo por encima de la válvula ileocecal, donde el intestino delgado se une al intestino grueso.


===== Líneas verticales =====

Las dos líneas verticales o medias de Poupart se dibujan desde el punto medio entre la espina anterosuperior y la sínfisis púbica de cada lado, verticalmente hacia arriba hasta el margen costal.

La derecha es la más valiosa, ya que la válvula íleo-cecal se sitúa en el corte de la línea intertubercular.

El orificio del apéndice se encuentra una pulgada más abajo, en el punto de McBurney.

En su parte superior, la línea vertical se encuentra con la línea transpilórica en el margen inferior de las costillas, generalmente la novena, y aquí se sitúa la vesícula biliar.

La línea media de Poupart izquierda corresponde en sus tres cuartos superiores al borde interno del colon descendente. El margen subcostal derecho corresponde al límite inferior del hígado, mientras que el pezón derecho se encuentra aproximadamente media pulgada por encima de su límite superior.


=== Cuadrantes y regiones ===


El abdomen se puede dividir en cuadrantes o regiones para describir la ubicación de un órgano o estructura.

Clásicamente, los cuadrantes se describen como superior izquierdo, inferior izquierdo, superior derecho e inferior derecho.

Los cuadrantes también se utilizan a menudo para describir el sitio de un dolor abdominal. El abdomen también se puede dividir en nueve regiones.

Estos términos provienen de "hypo" que significa "abajo" y "epi" significa "arriba", mientras que "chondron" significa "cartílago" (en este caso, el cartílago de la costilla) y "gaster" significa estómago.

La inversión de "izquierda" y "derecha" es intencional, porque las designaciones anatómicas reflejan la derecha y la izquierda del propio paciente).
La "fosa ilíaca derecha" (RIF) es un sitio común de dolor y sensibilidad en pacientes que tienen apendicitis.

La fosa lleva el nombre de la fosa ilíaca subyacente del hueso de la cadera y, por lo tanto, es algo imprecisa.

La mayoría de las estructuras anatómicas que producirán dolor y sensibilidad en esta región no se encuentran de hecho en la concavidad del íleon.

Sin embargo, el término es de uso común.


== Otros animales ==


En los artrópodos, el abdomen está formado por una serie de placas superiores conocidas como tergitos y placas inferiores conocidas como esternitos, el conjunto se mantiene unido por una membrana resistente pero elástica.
El abdomen contiene el tracto digestivo y los órganos reproductivos del insecto. Consta de once segmentos en la mayoría de los órdenes de insectos, aunque el undécimo segmento está ausente en el adulto de la mayoría de los órdenes superiores.

El número de estos segmentos varía de una especie a otra, y el número de segmentos visibles se reduce a solo siete en la abeja común.

En el Collembola (Springtails) el abdomen tiene sólo seis segmentos.
El abdomen a veces está muy modificado.

En Apocrita (abejas, hormigas y avispas), el primer segmento del abdomen está fusionado con el tórax y se llama propodeo.

En las hormigas, el segundo segmento forma el pecíolo estrecho.

Algunas hormigas tienen un segmento pospeciolo adicional y los segmentos restantes forman el gáster bulboso.

El pecíolo y el gáster (segmentos abdominales 2 en adelante) se denominan colectivamente metasoma.
A diferencia de otros artrópodos, los insectos no poseen patas en el abdomen en forma adulta, aunque Protura tiene apéndices rudimentarios en forma de patas en los tres primeros segmentos abdominales, y Archaeognatha posee pequeños "estilos" articulados que a veces se consideran apéndices rudimentarios.

Muchas larvas de insectos, incluidos los lepidópteros y los Symphyta (moscas de sierra), tienen apéndices carnosos llamados propatas en sus segmentos abdominales (así como sus patas torácicas más familiares), que les permiten agarrarse a los bordes de las hojas de las plantas mientras caminan.
En los arácnidos (arañas, escorpiones y parientes), el término "abdomen" se usa indistintamente con "opistosoma" ("cuerpo trasero"), que es la sección del cuerpo posterior a la que lleva las piernas y la cabeza (el prosoma o cefalotórax).

ABDÔMEN


O abdômen (coloquialmente chamado de barriga, barriga, barriga, estômago, tucky ou stocham) é a parte do corpo entre o tórax (peito) e a pelve, em humanos e em outros vertebrados.

O abdômen é a parte frontal do segmento abdominal do tronco.

A área ocupada pelo abdômen é chamada de cavidade abdominal.

Nos artrópodes é o tagma posterior do corpo; segue o tórax ou cefalotórax.

Em humanos, o abdome se estende do tórax no diafragma torácico até a pelve na borda pélvica.

A borda pélvica se estende da articulação lombossacral (o disco intervertebral entre L5 e S1) até a sínfise púbica e é a borda da entrada pélvica.

O espaço acima desta entrada e sob o diafragma torácico é denominado cavidade abdominal.

O limite da cavidade abdominal é a parede abdominal na frente e a superfície peritoneal na parte traseira.

Nos vertebrados, o abdome é uma grande cavidade corporal cercada pelos músculos abdominais, na frente e nas laterais, e por parte da coluna vertebral na parte de trás.

As costelas inferiores também podem envolver as paredes ventral e lateral.

A cavidade abdominal é contínua e acima da cavidade pélvica.

Está ligado à cavidade torácica pelo diafragma.

Estruturas como a aorta, a veia cava inferior e o esôfago passam pelo diafragma.

As cavidades abdominal e pélvica são revestidas por uma membrana serosa conhecida como peritônio parietal.

Esta membrana é contínua com o peritônio visceral que reveste os órgãos.

O abdômen em vertebrados contém vários órgãos pertencentes, por exemplo, ao sistema digestivo, sistema urinário e sistema muscular.


== Conteúdo ==


A cavidade abdominal contém a maioria dos órgãos do sistema digestivo, incluindo o estômago, o intestino delgado e o cólon com seu apêndice anexado.

Outros órgãos digestivos são conhecidos como órgãos digestivos acessórios e incluem o fígado, sua vesícula biliar anexada e o pâncreas, e estes se comunicam com o resto do sistema através de vários ductos.

O baço e os órgãos do sistema urinário, incluindo os rins e as glândulas supra-renais, também se encontram dentro do abdômen, juntamente com muitos vasos sanguíneos, incluindo a aorta e a veia cava inferior.

A bexiga urinária, o útero, as trompas de Falópio e os ovários podem ser vistos como órgãos abdominais ou como órgãos pélvicos.

Finalmente, o abdome contém uma extensa membrana chamada peritônio.

Uma dobra de peritônio pode cobrir completamente certos órgãos, enquanto pode cobrir apenas um lado dos órgãos que geralmente ficam mais próximos da parede abdominal.

Isso é chamado de retroperitônio, e os rins e ureteres são conhecidos como órgãos retroperitoneais.
Os órgãos abdominais podem ser altamente especializados em alguns animais.

Por exemplo, o estômago dos ruminantes (uma subordem de mamíferos que inclui bovinos e ovinos) é dividido em quatro câmaras – rúmen, retículo, omaso e abomaso.

 


== Músculos ==


Existem três camadas de músculos na parede abdominal.

São eles, de fora para dentro: oblíquo externo, oblíquo interno e transverso abdominal.

As três primeiras camadas se estendem entre a coluna vertebral, as costelas inferiores, a crista ilíaca e o púbis do quadril.

Todas as suas fibras se fundem em direção à linha média e envolvem o reto abdominal em uma bainha antes de se unirem no lado oposto na linha alba.

A força é adquirida pelo cruzamento de fibras, de modo que o oblíquo externo corre para baixo e para frente, o oblíquo interno para cima e para frente e o transverso abdominal horizontalmente para frente.

O músculo transverso do abdome é plano e triangular, com suas fibras correndo horizontalmente.

Situa-se entre o oblíquo interno e a fáscia transversa subjacente.

Origina-se do ligamento inguinal, cartilagens costais 7-12, crista ilíaca e fáscia toracolombar.

Insere-se no tendão conjunto, processo xifóide, linha alba e crista púbica.
Os músculos retos abdominais são longos e planos.

O músculo é cruzado por três bandas fibrosas chamadas interseções tendíneas.

O reto abdominal é envolvido por uma bainha espessa, formada como descrito acima, por fibras de cada um dos três músculos da parede abdominal lateral.

Originam-se no osso púbico, sobem pelo abdome em ambos os lados da linha alba e se inserem nas cartilagens da quinta, sexta e sétima costelas.

Na região da virilha, o canal inguinal, é uma passagem pelas camadas.

Esta lacuna é onde os testículos podem cair através da parede e onde corre o cordão fibroso do útero na fêmea.

É também aqui que a fraqueza pode se formar e causar hérnias inguinais. O músculo piramidal é pequeno e triangular.

Ele está localizado na parte inferior do abdome na frente do reto abdominal.

Origina-se no osso púbico e insere-se na linha alba a meio caminho do umbigo.


== Função ==


Funcionalmente, o abdômen humano é onde a maior parte do trato digestivo está localizada e, portanto, a maior parte da absorção e digestão dos alimentos ocorre aqui.

O trato alimentar no abdome consiste no esôfago inferior, estômago, duodeno, jejuno, íleo, ceco e apêndice, cólon ascendente, transverso e descendente, cólon sigmóide e reto.

Outros órgãos vitais dentro do abdômen incluem o fígado, os rins, o pâncreas e o baço.

A parede abdominal é dividida em paredes posterior (traseira), lateral (lados) e anterior (frente).


=== Movimento, respiração e outras funções ===

Os músculos abdominais têm diferentes funções importantes.

Eles auxiliam como músculos da expiração no processo de respiração durante a expiração vigorosa.

Além disso, esses músculos servem como proteção para os órgãos internos.

Além disso, juntamente com os músculos das costas, fornecem suporte postural e são importantes na definição da forma.

Quando a glote está fechada e o tórax e a pelve fixos, eles são parte integrante das funções de tosse, micção, defecação, parto, vômito e canto.

Quando a pelve está fixa, eles podem iniciar o movimento do tronco em um movimento para frente.

Eles também impedem a hiperextensão.

Quando o tórax é fixado, eles podem puxar a pelve para cima e, finalmente, podem dobrar a coluna vertebral lateralmente e auxiliar na rotação do tronco.


=== Postura ===

O músculo transverso do abdome é o músculo mais profundo, portanto, não pode ser tocado de fora.

Pode afetar muito a postura do corpo.

Os oblíquos internos também são profundos e também afetam a postura corporal.

Ambos estão envolvidos na rotação e flexão lateral da coluna e são usados ​​para dobrar e apoiar a coluna pela frente.

Os oblíquos externos são mais superficiais e também estão envolvidos na rotação e flexão lateral da coluna.

Também estabilizam a coluna quando estão na posição vertical.

O músculo reto abdominal não é o músculo abdominal mais superficial.

A bainha tendinosa que se estende dos oblíquos externos cobre o reto abdominal.

O reto abdominal é o músculo que as pessoas muito em forma desenvolvem na aparência de 6-pack ab.

Embora deva realmente ser um pacote de 10, pois existem 5 seções verticais de cada lado.

As 2 seções inferiores estão logo acima do osso púbico e geralmente não são visíveis, portanto, os 6 pack abs.

A função do reto abdominal é dobrar as costas para frente (flexão).

O principal trabalho dos músculos abdominais é dobrar a coluna para frente ao se contrair concentricamente.


== Sociedade e cultura ==


As percepções sociais e culturais da aparência externa do abdome têm significados variados em todo o mundo.

Dependendo do tipo de sociedade, o excesso de peso pode ser percebido como um indicador de riqueza e prestígio devido ao excesso de alimentos, ou como um sinal de saúde precária devido à falta de exercícios.

Em muitas culturas, abdômens nus são distintamente sexualizados e percebidos de forma semelhante ao decote dos seios.


== Exercício ==

Sendo elementos-chave do suporte da coluna e contribuintes para uma boa postura, é importante exercitar adequadamente os músculos abdominais juntamente com os músculos das costas, pois quando estes estão fracos ou excessivamente tensos podem sofrer espasmos dolorosos e lesões.

Quando exercitados adequadamente, os músculos abdominais contribuem para melhorar a postura e o equilíbrio, reduzem a probabilidade de episódios de dor nas costas, reduzem a gravidade da dor nas costas, protegem contra lesões respondendo eficientemente ao estresse, ajudam a evitar algumas cirurgias nas costas e ajudam na cicatrização das costas problemas, ou após a cirurgia da coluna vertebral.

Quando fortalecidos, os músculos abdominais também proporcionam flexibilidade.

Os músculos abdominais podem ser trabalhados praticando disciplinas de força geral do corpo, como Pilates, ioga, T'ai chi e corrida.

Existem também rotinas específicas que visam cada um desses músculos.


== Significado clínico ==

A obesidade abdominal é uma condição em que a gordura abdominal ou gordura visceral se acumulou excessivamente entre os órgãos abdominais.

Isso está associado a um maior risco de doenças cardíacas, asma e diabetes tipo 2.

O trauma abdominal é uma lesão no abdômen e pode envolver danos aos órgãos abdominais.

Existe um risco associado de perda grave de sangue e infecção.

Lesões na parte inferior do tórax podem causar lesões no baço e no fígado. Um abdômen escafóide é quando o abdômen é sugado para dentro.

Em um recém-nascido, pode representar uma hérnia diafragmática.

Em geral, é indicativo de desnutrição.


=== Doença ===


Muitas doenças gastrointestinais afetam os órgãos abdominais.

Estes incluem doença do estômago, doença hepática, doença pancreática, vesícula biliar e doença do ducto biliar; doenças intestinais incluem enterite, doença celíaca, diverticulite e SII.


=== Exame ===

Diferentes procedimentos médicos podem ser usados ​​para examinar os órgãos do trato gastrointestinal.

Estes incluem endoscopia, colonoscopia, sigmoidoscopia, enteroscopia, esofagogastroduodenoscopia e colonoscopia virtual.

Há também uma série de técnicas de imagem médica que podem ser usadas.

Os pontos de referência da superfície são importantes no exame do abdome.


==== Marcos de superfície ====

Na linha média, um leve sulco se estende do processo xifóide acima até a sínfise púbica abaixo, representando a linha alba na parede abdominal.

Em torno de seu ponto médio fica o umbigo ou umbigo.

O reto abdominal de cada lado da linha alba se destaca em pessoas musculosas.

O contorno desses músculos é interrompido por três ou mais depressões transversais indicando as interseções tendíneas.

Geralmente há um sobre o processo xifóide, um no umbigo e um no meio.

É a combinação da linha alba e as interseções tendíneas que formam o "six-pack" abdominal procurado por muitas pessoas.

O limite lateral superior do abdome é a margem subcostal (no ou próximo ao plano subcostal) formada pelas cartilagens das costelas falsas (8, 9, 10) que se unem.

O limite lateral inferior é a crista anterior do ílio e o ligamento de Poupart, que vai da espinha ântero-superior do ílio até a espinha do púbis.

Esses limites inferiores são marcados por sulcos visíveis.

Logo acima das espinhas púbicas de cada lado estão os anéis abdominais externos, que são aberturas na parede muscular do abdome através das quais o cordão espermático emerge no homem e através dos quais uma hérnia inguinal pode se romper.

Um método pelo qual a localização do conteúdo abdominal pode ser apreciada é desenhar três linhas horizontais e duas verticais.


===== Linhas horizontais =====

A mais alta da primeira é a linha transpilórica de C.

Addison, que está situado a meio caminho entre a incisura supraesternal e o topo da sínfise púbica, e muitas vezes corta a abertura pilórica do estômago uma polegada à direita da linha média.

O hilo de cada rim está um pouco abaixo dele, enquanto sua extremidade esquerda toca aproximadamente o limite inferior do baço.

Corresponde à primeira vértebra lombar posterior.
A segunda linha é a linha subcostal, traçada a partir do ponto mais baixo do arco subcostal (décima costela).

Corresponde à parte superior da terceira vértebra lombar e está cerca de uma polegada acima do umbigo.

Indica aproximadamente o cólon transverso, as extremidades inferiores dos rins e o limite superior da parte transversa (3ª) do duodeno.

A terceira linha é chamada de linha intertubercular e atravessa os dois tubérculos ásperos, que podem ser sentidos no lábio externo da crista do ílio a cerca de 64 mm da espinha ântero-superior.

Esta linha corresponde ao corpo da quinta vértebra lombar e passa através ou logo acima da válvula íleo-cecal, onde o intestino delgado se une ao intestino grosso.


===== Linhas verticais =====

As duas linhas verticais ou médias de Poupart são traçadas a partir do ponto médio entre a espinha anterossuperior e a sínfise púbica de cada lado, verticalmente para cima até o rebordo costal.

A direita é a mais valiosa, pois a válvula íleo-cecal está situada onde corta a linha intertubercular.

O orifício do apêndice fica uma polegada abaixo, no ponto de McBurney.

Na sua parte superior, a linha vertical encontra a linha transpilórica na margem inferior das costelas, geralmente a nona, e aqui está situada a vesícula biliar.

A linha média de Poupart esquerda corresponde em seus três quartos superiores à borda interna do cólon descendente. A margem subcostal direita corresponde ao limite inferior do fígado, enquanto o mamilo direito está cerca de meia polegada acima de seu limite superior.


=== Quadrantes e regiões ===


O abdome pode ser dividido em quadrantes ou regiões para descrever a localização de um órgão ou estrutura.

Classicamente, os quadrantes são descritos como superior esquerdo, inferior esquerdo, superior direito e inferior direito.

Quadrantes também são frequentemente usados ​​para descrever o local de uma dor abdominal. O abdome também pode ser dividido em nove regiões.

Esses termos derivam de "hipo" que significa "abaixo" e "epi" significa "acima", enquanto "chondron" significa "cartilagem" (neste caso, a cartilagem da costela) e "gaster" significa estômago.

A inversão de "esquerda" e "direita" é intencional, porque as designações anatômicas refletem a direita e a esquerda do próprio paciente.)
A "fossa ilíaca direita" (FID) é um local comum de dor e sensibilidade em pacientes com apendicite.

A fossa é nomeada para a fossa ilíaca subjacente do osso do quadril e, portanto, é um pouco imprecisa.

A maioria das estruturas anatômicas que produzirão dor e sensibilidade nessa região não estão de fato na concavidade do íleo.

No entanto, o termo é de uso comum.


== Outros animais ==


Nos artrópodes, o abdome é formado por uma série de placas superiores conhecidas como tergitos e placas inferiores conhecidas como esternitos, sendo o todo mantido unido por uma membrana resistente, porém elástica.
O abdômen contém o trato digestivo e os órgãos reprodutivos do inseto, consiste em onze segmentos na maioria das ordens de insetos, embora o décimo primeiro segmento esteja ausente no adulto da maioria das ordens superiores.

O número desses segmentos varia de espécie para espécie, com o número de segmentos visíveis reduzido para apenas sete na abelha comum.

No Collembola (Springtails) o abdômen tem apenas seis segmentos.
O abdômen às vezes é altamente modificado.

Em Apocrita (abelhas, formigas e vespas), o primeiro segmento do abdômen é fundido ao tórax e é chamado de propódeo.

Nas formigas, o segundo segmento forma o pecíolo estreito.

Algumas formigas têm um segmento pós-pecíolo adicional e os segmentos restantes formam o gáster bulboso.

O pecíolo e o gáster (segmentos abdominais 2 em diante) são chamados coletivamente de metassoma.
Ao contrário de outros artrópodes, os insetos não possuem pernas no abdômen na forma adulta, embora os Protura tenham apêndices rudimentares semelhantes a pernas nos três primeiros segmentos abdominais, e os Archaeognatha possuam "estilos" pequenos e articulados que às vezes são considerados apêndices rudimentares.

Muitos insetos larvais, incluindo os Lepidoptera e os Symphyta (sawflies), têm apêndices carnudos chamados prolegs em seus segmentos abdominais (assim como suas pernas torácicas mais familiares), que lhes permitem agarrar as bordas das folhas das plantas enquanto andam.
Em aracnídeos (aranhas, escorpiões e parentes), o termo "abdômen" é usado de forma intercambiável com "opisthosoma" ("corpo posterior"), que é a seção do corpo posterior àquela que contém as pernas e a cabeça (o prossoma ou cefalotórax).

ABDOMEN


L'abdomen (familièrement appelé le ventre, le ventre, le ventre, l'estomac, le tucky ou le stocham) est la partie du corps située entre le thorax (poitrine) et le bassin, chez l'homme et chez les autres vertébrés.

L'abdomen est la partie antérieure du segment abdominal du torse.

La zone occupée par l'abdomen s'appelle la cavité abdominale.

Chez les arthropodes, c'est le tagma postérieur du corps; il suit le thorax ou le céphalothorax.

Chez l'homme, l'abdomen s'étend du thorax au diaphragme thoracique au bassin au bord pelvien.

Le bord pelvien s'étend de l'articulation lombo-sacrée (le disque intervertébral entre L5 et S1) à la symphyse pubienne et constitue le bord de l'entrée pelvienne.

L'espace au-dessus de cette entrée et sous le diaphragme thoracique est appelé la cavité abdominale.

La limite de la cavité abdominale est la paroi abdominale à l'avant et la surface péritonéale à l'arrière.

Chez les vertébrés, l'abdomen est une grande cavité corporelle délimitée par les muscles abdominaux, à l'avant et sur les côtés, et par une partie de la colonne vertébrale à l'arrière.

Les côtes inférieures peuvent également entourer les parois ventrales et latérales.

La cavité abdominale est continue avec et au-dessus de la cavité pelvienne.

Il est attaché à la cavité thoracique par le diaphragme.

Des structures telles que l'aorte, la veine cave inférieure et l'œsophage traversent le diaphragme.

Les cavités abdominale et pelvienne sont tapissées d'une membrane séreuse appelée péritoine pariétal.

Cette membrane est en continuité avec le péritoine viscéral tapissant les organes.

L'abdomen des vertébrés contient un certain nombre d'organes appartenant, par exemple, au système digestif, au système urinaire et au système musculaire.


== Contenu ==


La cavité abdominale contient la plupart des organes du système digestif, y compris l'estomac, l'intestin grêle et le côlon avec son appendice attaché.

D'autres organes digestifs sont connus sous le nom d'organes digestifs accessoires et comprennent le foie, sa vésicule biliaire attachée et le pancréas, et ceux-ci communiquent avec le reste du système via divers conduits.

La rate et les organes du système urinaire, y compris les reins et les glandes surrénales, se trouvent également dans l'abdomen, ainsi que de nombreux vaisseaux sanguins, dont l'aorte et la veine cave inférieure.

La vessie, l'utérus, les trompes de Fallope et les ovaires peuvent être considérés comme des organes abdominaux ou comme des organes pelviens.

Enfin, l'abdomen contient une vaste membrane appelée péritoine.

Un pli de péritoine peut couvrir complètement certains organes, alors qu'il peut ne couvrir qu'un côté des organes qui se trouvent généralement plus près de la paroi abdominale.

C'est ce qu'on appelle le rétropéritoine, et les reins et les uretères sont appelés organes rétropéritonéaux.
Les organes abdominaux peuvent être hautement spécialisés chez certains animaux.

Par exemple, l'estomac des ruminants (un sous-ordre de mammifères qui comprend les bovins et les ovins) est divisé en quatre chambres : le rumen, le réticulum, l'omasum et la caillette.

 


== Muscles ==


Il y a trois couches de muscles dans la paroi abdominale.

Ce sont, de l'extérieur vers l'intérieur : l'oblique externe, l'oblique interne et l'abdominal transversal.

Les trois premières couches s'étendent entre la colonne vertébrale, les côtes inférieures, la crête iliaque et le pubis de la hanche.

Toutes leurs fibres se rejoignent vers la ligne médiane et entourent le rectus abdominis dans une gaine avant de se rejoindre du côté opposé au niveau de la linea alba.

La force est acquise par l'entrecroisement des fibres, de sorte que l'oblique externe s'étend vers le bas et vers l'avant, l'oblique interne vers le haut et vers l'avant et l'abdomen transversal horizontalement vers l'avant.

Le muscle transverse de l'abdomen est plat et triangulaire, ses fibres s'étendant horizontalement.

Il se situe entre l'oblique interne et le fascia transverse sous-jacent.

Il provient du ligament inguinal, des cartilages costaux 7-12, de la crête iliaque et du fascia thoraco-lombaire.

S'insère dans le tendon conjoint, le processus xiphoïde, la ligne blanche et la crête pubienne.
Les muscles droits de l'abdomen sont longs et plats.

Le muscle est traversé par trois bandes fibreuses appelées intersections tendineuses.

Le droit de l'abdomen est enfermé dans une gaine épaisse, formée comme décrit ci-dessus, par des fibres provenant de chacun des trois muscles de la paroi abdominale latérale.

Ils prennent naissance au niveau de l'os pubien, remontent l'abdomen de chaque côté de la linea alba et s'insèrent dans les cartilages des cinquième, sixième et septième côtes.

Dans la région de l'aine, le canal inguinal, est un passage à travers les couches.

Cet espace est l'endroit où les testicules peuvent tomber à travers le mur et où passe le cordon fibreux de l'utérus chez la femme.

C'est également là que la faiblesse peut se former et provoquer des hernies inguinales. Le muscle pyramidal est petit et triangulaire.

Il est situé dans le bas-ventre devant le rectus abdominis.

Il prend naissance au niveau de l'os pubien et s'insère dans la linea alba à mi-chemin jusqu'au nombril.


== Fonction ==


Fonctionnellement, l'abdomen humain est l'endroit où se trouve la majeure partie du tube digestif et donc la majeure partie de l'absorption et de la digestion des aliments se produit ici.

Le tube digestif dans l'abdomen comprend le bas de l'œsophage, l'estomac, le duodénum, ​​le jéjunum, l'iléon, le caecum et l'appendice, les côlons ascendant, transverse et descendant, le côlon sigmoïde et le rectum.

D'autres organes vitaux à l'intérieur de l'abdomen comprennent le foie, les reins, le pancréas et la rate.

La paroi abdominale est divisée en parois postérieure (arrière), latérales (côtés) et antérieures (avant).


=== Mouvement, respiration et autres fonctions ===

Les muscles abdominaux ont différentes fonctions importantes.

Ils aident en tant que muscles d'expiration dans le processus de respiration lors d'une expiration forcée.

De plus, ces muscles servent de protection aux organes internes.

De plus, avec les muscles du dos, ils fournissent un soutien postural et sont importants pour définir la forme.

Lorsque la glotte est fermée et que le thorax et le bassin sont fixés, ils font partie intégrante des fonctions de toux, d'urination, de défécation, d'accouchement, de vomissement et de chant.

Lorsque le bassin est fixe, ils peuvent initier le mouvement du tronc dans un mouvement vers l'avant.

Ils préviennent également l'hyperextension.

Lorsque le thorax est fixé, ils peuvent remonter le bassin et enfin, ils peuvent fléchir latéralement la colonne vertébrale et aider à la rotation du tronc.


=== Attitude ===

Le muscle transverse de l'abdomen est le muscle le plus profond, il ne peut donc pas être touché de l'extérieur.

Cela peut grandement affecter la posture du corps.

Les obliques internes sont également profondes et affectent également la posture du corps.

Les deux sont impliqués dans la rotation et la flexion latérale de la colonne vertébrale et sont utilisés pour plier et soutenir la colonne vertébrale de l'avant.

Les obliques externes sont plus superficiels et participent également à la rotation et à la flexion latérale de la colonne vertébrale.

De plus, ils stabilisent la colonne vertébrale en position verticale.

Le muscle droit de l'abdomen n'est pas le muscle abdominal le plus superficiel.

La gaine tendineuse partant des obliques externes recouvre le droit de l'abdomen.

Le rectus abdominis est le muscle que les personnes très en forme développent dans le look 6-pack ab.

Bien qu'il devrait vraiment s'agir d'un pack de 10 car il y a 5 sections verticales de chaque côté.

Les 2 sections inférieures sont juste au-dessus de l'os pubien et ne sont généralement pas visibles, d'où les 6 pack abs.

La fonction des abdominaux droits est de plier le dos vers l'avant (flexion).

Le travail principal des muscles abdominaux consiste à plier la colonne vertébrale vers l'avant lors de la contraction concentrique.


== Société et culture ==


Les perceptions sociales et culturelles de l'apparence extérieure de l'abdomen ont une signification variable dans le monde.

Selon le type de société, le surpoids peut être perçu comme un indicateur de richesse et de prestige dû à l'excès de nourriture, ou comme un signe de mauvaise santé dû au manque d'exercice.

Dans de nombreuses cultures, les abdomens nus sont nettement sexualisés et perçus de la même manière que le décolleté des seins.


== Exercice ==

Étant des éléments clés du soutien de la colonne vertébrale et contribuant à une bonne posture, il est important d'exercer correctement les muscles abdominaux ainsi que les muscles du dos, car lorsqu'ils sont faibles ou trop tendus, ils peuvent souffrir de spasmes douloureux et de blessures.

Lorsqu'ils sont correctement exercés, les muscles abdominaux contribuent à améliorer la posture et l'équilibre, réduisent la probabilité d'épisodes de maux de dos, réduisent la gravité des maux de dos, protègent contre les blessures en répondant efficacement aux contraintes, aident à éviter certaines chirurgies du dos et aident à la guérison du dos. problèmes, ou après une chirurgie de la colonne vertébrale.

Lorsqu'ils sont renforcés, les muscles abdominaux offrent également de la flexibilité.

Les muscles abdominaux peuvent être travaillés en pratiquant des disciplines de force corporelle générale telles que le Pilates, le yoga, le T'ai chi et le jogging.

Il existe également des routines spécifiques qui ciblent chacun de ces muscles.


== Signification clinique ==

L'obésité abdominale est une condition dans laquelle la graisse abdominale ou la graisse viscérale s'est accumulée de manière excessive entre les organes abdominaux.

Ceci est associé à un risque plus élevé de maladie cardiaque, d'asthme et de diabète de type 2.

Un traumatisme abdominal est une blessure à l'abdomen et peut entraîner des dommages aux organes abdominaux.

Il existe un risque associé de perte de sang grave et d'infection.

Une blessure au bas de la poitrine peut causer des blessures à la rate et au foie. Un abdomen scaphoïde se produit lorsque l'abdomen est aspiré vers l'intérieur.

Chez un nouveau-né, cela peut représenter une hernie diaphragmatique.

En général, c'est le signe d'une dénutrition.


=== Maladie ===


De nombreuses maladies gastro-intestinales affectent les organes abdominaux.

Celles-ci comprennent les maladies de l'estomac, les maladies du foie, les maladies du pancréas, les maladies de la vésicule biliaire et des voies biliaires ; les maladies intestinales comprennent l'entérite, la maladie cœliaque, la diverticulite et le SCI.


=== Examen ===

Différentes procédures médicales peuvent être utilisées pour examiner les organes du tractus gastro-intestinal.

Celles-ci comprennent l'endoscopie, la coloscopie, la sigmoïdoscopie, l'entéroscopie, l'œsophagogastroduodénoscopie et la coloscopie virtuelle.

Il existe également un certain nombre de techniques d'imagerie médicale qui peuvent être utilisées.

Les repères de surface sont importants dans l'examen de l'abdomen.


==== Repères de surface ====

Sur la ligne médiane, un léger sillon s'étend du processus xiphoïde au-dessus à la symphyse pubienne en dessous, représentant la linea alba dans la paroi abdominale.

À peu près à son milieu se trouve l'ombilic ou le nombril.

Le rectus abdominis de chaque côté de la linea alba se distingue chez les personnes musclées.

Le contour de ces muscles est interrompu par trois ou plusieurs dépressions transversales indiquant les intersections tendineuses.

Il y en a généralement un sur le processus xiphoïde, un sur le nombril et un entre les deux.

C'est l'association de la linea alba et des intersections tendineuses qui forment le "six-pack" abdominal recherché par de nombreuses personnes.

La limite latérale supérieure de l'abdomen est le rebord sous-costal (au niveau ou à proximité du plan sous-costal) formé par les cartilages des fausses côtes (8, 9, 10) qui se rejoignent.

La limite latérale inférieure est la crête antérieure de l'ilium et le ligament de Poupart, qui va de l'épine antéro-supérieure de l'ilium à l'épine du pubis.

Ces limites inférieures sont marquées par des rainures visibles.

Juste au-dessus des épines pubiennes de chaque côté se trouvent les anneaux abdominaux externes, qui sont des ouvertures dans la paroi musculaire de l'abdomen à travers lesquelles le cordon spermatique émerge chez l'homme et à travers lesquelles une hernie inguinale peut se rompre.

Une méthode permettant d'apprécier l'emplacement du contenu abdominal consiste à tracer trois lignes horizontales et deux lignes verticales.


===== Lignes horizontales =====

La plus élevée des premières est la ligne transpylorique de C.

Addison, qui est situé à mi-chemin entre l'échancrure suprasternale et le sommet de la symphyse pubienne, et coupe souvent l'ouverture pylorique de l'estomac à un pouce à droite de la ligne médiane.

Le hile de chaque rein est un peu en dessous, tandis que son extrémité gauche touche approximativement la limite inférieure de la rate.

Elle correspond à la première vertèbre lombaire en arrière.
La deuxième ligne est la ligne sous-costale, tracée à partir du point le plus bas de l'arc sous-costal (dixième côte).

Il correspond à la partie supérieure de la troisième vertèbre lombaire et se situe à environ un pouce au-dessus de l'ombilic.

Il indique approximativement le côlon transverse, les extrémités inférieures des reins et la limite supérieure de la partie transversale (3ème) du duodénum.

La troisième ligne s'appelle la ligne intertuberculaire et traverse entre les deux tubercules rugueux, qui peuvent être ressentis sur la lèvre externe de la crête de l'ilium à environ deux pouces et demi (64 mm) de la colonne vertébrale supérieure antérieure.

Cette ligne correspond au corps de la cinquième vertèbre lombaire et passe à travers ou juste au-dessus de la valve iléo-cæcale, là où l'intestin grêle rejoint le gros intestin.


===== Lignes verticales =====

Les deux lignes verticales ou mi-Poupart sont tracées à partir du point à mi-chemin entre l'épine antéro-supérieure et la symphyse pubienne de chaque côté, verticalement vers le haut jusqu'au rebord costal.

Celle de droite est la plus précieuse, car la valve iléo-cæcale est située à l'endroit où elle coupe la ligne intertuberculaire.

L'orifice de l'appendice se trouve un pouce plus bas, au point de McBurney.

Dans sa partie supérieure, la ligne verticale rencontre la ligne transpylorique au bord inférieur des côtes, généralement la neuvième, et c'est ici que se trouve la vésicule biliaire.

La ligne médiane de Poupart gauche correspond dans ses trois quarts supérieurs au bord interne du côlon descendant. Le rebord sous-costal droit correspond à la limite inférieure du foie, tandis que le mamelon droit se situe environ un demi-pouce au-dessus de sa limite supérieure.


=== Quadrants et régions ===


L'abdomen peut être divisé en quadrants ou régions pour décrire l'emplacement d'un organe ou d'une structure.

Classiquement, les quadrants sont décrits comme supérieur gauche, inférieur gauche, supérieur droit et inférieur droit.

Les quadrants sont également souvent utilisés pour décrire le site d'une douleur abdominale. L'abdomen peut également être divisé en neuf régions.

Ces termes proviennent de "hypo" signifiant "en dessous" et "epi" signifie "au-dessus", tandis que "chondron" signifie "cartilage" (dans ce cas, le cartilage de la côte) et "gaster" signifie estomac.

L'inversion de « gauche » et « droite » est intentionnelle, car les désignations anatomiques reflètent la droite et la gauche du patient.)
La "fosse iliaque droite" (RIF) est un site courant de douleur et de sensibilité chez les patients qui ont une appendicite.

La fosse porte le nom de la fosse iliaque sous-jacente de l'os de la hanche et est donc quelque peu imprécise.

La plupart des structures anatomiques qui produiront de la douleur et de la sensibilité dans cette région ne se trouvent en fait pas dans la concavité de l'iléon.

Cependant, le terme est d'usage courant.

Chez les arthropodes, l'abdomen est constitué d'une série de plaques supérieures appelées tergites et de plaques inférieures appelées sternites, le tout étant maintenu par une membrane résistante mais extensible.
L'abdomen contient le tube digestif et les organes reproducteurs de l'insecte. Il se compose de onze segments dans la plupart des ordres d'insectes, bien que le onzième segment soit absent chez l'adulte de la plupart des ordres supérieurs.

Le nombre de ces segments varie d'une espèce à l'autre, le nombre de segments visibles étant réduit à seulement sept chez l'abeille commune.

Chez les collemboles (collemboles), l'abdomen n'a que six segments.
L'abdomen est parfois très modifié.

Chez Apocrita (abeilles, fourmis et guêpes), le premier segment de l'abdomen est fusionné au thorax et s'appelle le propodeum.

Chez les fourmis, le deuxième segment forme le pétiole étroit.

Certaines fourmis ont un segment postpétiole supplémentaire et les segments restants forment le gaster bulbeux.

Le pétiole et le gaster (segments abdominaux 2 et suivants) sont collectivement appelés le métasome.
Contrairement aux autres arthropodes, les insectes ne possèdent pas de pattes sur l'abdomen sous forme adulte, bien que les Protura aient des appendices rudimentaires en forme de pattes sur les trois premiers segments abdominaux, et les Archaeognatha possèdent de petits "stylets" articulés qui sont parfois considérés comme des appendices rudimentaires.

De nombreux insectes larvaires, y compris les lépidoptères et les symphytes (mouches à scie), ont des appendices charnus appelés fausses pattes sur leurs segments abdominaux (ainsi que leurs pattes thoraciques plus familières), qui leur permettent de s'agripper aux bords des feuilles des plantes lorsqu'ils se promènent.
Chez les arachnides (araignées, scorpions et apparentés), le terme «abdomen» est utilisé de manière interchangeable avec «opisthosome» («corps postérieur»), qui est la partie du corps postérieure à celle portant les pattes et la tête (le prosoma ou céphalothorax).
