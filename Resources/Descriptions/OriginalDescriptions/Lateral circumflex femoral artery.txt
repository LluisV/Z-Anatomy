LATERAL CIRCUMFLEX FEMORAL ARTERY


The lateral circumflex femoral artery, also known as the lateral femoral circumflex artery, or the external circumflex artery, is an artery in the upper thigh.


== Structure ==

The lateral femoral circumflex artery usually arises from the lateral side of the profunda femoris artery, but may occasionally arise directly from the femoral artery. 

It is the largest branch of the profunda femoris artery. 

It passes horizontally between the divisions of the femoral nerve. 

It also passes behind the sartorius muscle and rectus femoris muscle. 

It divides into ascending, transverse, and descending branches. 

The artery usually courses anterior to the femoral neck.


=== Branches ===

The lateral circumflex femoral artery has three branches:

The ascending branch of lateral circumflex femoral artery passes upward, beneath the tensor fasciae latae muscle, to the lateral aspect of the hip, and anastomoses with the terminal branches of the superior gluteal and deep circumflex iliac artery.
The descending branch of lateral circumflex femoral artery runs downward, behind the rectus femoris, upon the vastus lateralis, to which it gives offsets; one long branch descends in the muscle as far as the knee, and anastomoses with the superior lateral genicular artery. 

It is accompanied by the branch of the femoral nerve to the vastus lateralis muscle.
The transverse branch of lateral circumflex femoral artery is a small artery in the thigh. 

It is the smallest branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery and passes lateralward over the vastus intermedius, pierces the vastus lateralis, and winds around the femur, just below the greater trochanter, anastomosing on the back of the thigh with the medial femoral circumflex artery, the inferior gluteal artery, and the perforating arteries of the profunda femoris artery.


=== Variation ===

The lateral femoral circumflex artery has a variable origin. 

In 67% of people, it arises 1.5 cm below the origin of the profunda femoris artery, and in others it arises at different distances from the origin. 

In up to 20% of people, it arises directly from the femoral artery.
A rare variant, where the lateral circumflex femoral artery passes posterior to the femoral nerve, has also been reported. 

This is significant in orthopaedic surgery.
