BRACHIOCEPHALIC VEIN


The left and right brachiocephalic veins (or innominate veins) are major veins in the upper chest, formed by the union of each corresponding internal jugular vein and subclavian vein. 

This is at the level of the sternoclavicular joint. 

The left brachiocephalic vein is nearly always longer than the right.These veins merge to form the superior vena cava, a great vessel, posterior to the junction of the first costal cartilage with the manubrium of the sternum.The brachiocephalic veins are the major veins returning blood to the superior vena cava.


== Tributaries ==


The brachiocephalic vein is formed by the confluence of the subclavian and internal jugular veins. 

In addition it receives drainage from:

Left and right internal thoracic vein (Also called internal mammary veins): drain into the inferior border of their corresponding vein
Left and right inferior thyroid veins: drain into the superior aspect of their corresponding veins near the confluence
Left and right vertebral vein
Left superior intercostal vein: drains into the left brachiocephalic vein


== Embryological origin ==

The left brachiocephalic vein forms from the anastomosis formed between the left and right anterior cardinal veins when the caudal portion of the left anterior cardinal vein degenerates.
