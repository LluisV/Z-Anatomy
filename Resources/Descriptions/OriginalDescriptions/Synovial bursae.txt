SYNOVIAL BURSA


A synovial bursa (plural bursae or bursas) is a small fluid-filled sac lined by synovial membrane with an inner capillary layer of viscous synovial fluid (similar in consistency to that of a raw egg white). 

It provides a cushion between bones and tendons and/or muscles around a joint. 

This helps to reduce friction between the bones and allows free movement. 

Bursae are found around most major joints of the body.


== Structure ==

There are four types of bursa: adventitious, subcutaneous, synovial, and sub-muscular. 

Among these, only adventitious is non-native. 

When any surface of the body is subjected to repeated stress, an adventitious bursa develops under it. 

Examples are Students' elbow and bunion.


== Clinical significance ==

Infection or irritation of a bursa leads to bursitis (inflammation of a bursa). 

The general term for disease of bursae is "bursopathy."


== History ==

=== Etymology ===

Bursa is Medieval Latin for "purse", so named for the resemblance of an anatomical bursa to a purse. 

Bursae or bursas is its plural form.
