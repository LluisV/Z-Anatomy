MAXILLARY ARTERY


The maxillary artery supplies deep structures of the face. 

It branches from the external carotid artery just deep to the neck of the mandible.


== Structure ==

The maxillary artery, the larger of the two terminal branches of the external carotid artery, arises behind the neck of the mandible, and is at first imbedded in the substance of the parotid gland; it passes forward between the ramus of the mandible and the sphenomandibular ligament, and then runs, either superficial or deep to the lateral pterygoid muscle, to the pterygopalatine fossa.
It supplies the deep structures of the face, and may be divided into mandibular, pterygoid, and pterygopalatine portions.


=== First portion ===

The first or mandibular or bony portion passes horizontally forward, between the neck of the mandible and the sphenomandibular ligament, where it lies parallel to and a little below the auriculotemporal nerve; it crosses the inferior alveolar nerve, and runs along the lower border of the lateral pterygoid muscle.
Branches include:

Deep auricular artery
Anterior tympanic artery
Middle meningeal artery
Inferior alveolar artery which gives off its mylohyoid branch just prior to entering the mandibular foramen
Accessory meningeal artery


=== Second portion ===

The second or pterygoid or muscular portion runs obliquely forward and upward under cover of the ramus of the mandible and insertion of the temporalis, on the superficial (very frequently on the deep) surface of the lateral pterygoid muscle; it then passes between the two heads of origin of this muscle and enters the fossa.
Branches include:

Masseteric artery
Pterygoid branches
Deep temporal arteries (anterior and posterior)
Buccal artery


=== Third portion ===

The third or pterygopalatine or pterygomaxillary portion lies in the pterygopalatine fossa in relation with the pterygopalatine ganglion. 

This is considered the terminal branch of the maxillary artery.
Branches include:

Sphenopalatine artery (nasopalatine artery) is the terminal branch of the Maxillary artery
Descending palatine artery (Greater palatine artery and lesser palatine artery)
Infraorbital artery
Posterior superior alveolar artery
Artery of pterygoid canal
Pharyngeal branch, directed to palatovaginal canal
Middle superior alveolar artery (a branch of the infraorbital artery)
Anterior superior alveolar arteries (a branch of the infraorbital artery)


== Nomenclature ==

Formerly, the term "external maxillary artery" was used to describe what is now known as the facial artery (per Terminologia anatomica.) Currently, the term "external maxillary artery" is less commonly used, and the terms "internal maxillary artery" and "maxillary artery" are equivalent.
