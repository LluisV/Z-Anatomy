TWELFTH THORACIC VERTEBRAE


The twelfth thoracic vertebra has the same general characteristics as the eleventh, but may be distinguished from it by its inferior articular surfaces being convex and directed lateralward, like those of the lumbar vertebrae; by the general form of the body, laminae, and spinous process, in which it resembles the lumbar vertebrae; and by each transverse process being subdivided into three elevations, the superior, inferior, and lateral tubercles: 
    
the superior and inferior correspond to the mammillary and accessory processes of the lumbar vertebrae.

Traces of similar elevations are found on the transverse processes of the tenth and eleventh thoracic vertebrae.

The thoracic spinal nerve 12 (T12) passes out underneath it.
