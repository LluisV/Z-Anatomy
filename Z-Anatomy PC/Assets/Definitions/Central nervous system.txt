CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM


The central nervous system (CNS) is the part of the nervous system consisting primarily of the brain and spinal cord. 

The CNS is so named because the brain integrates the received information and coordinates and influences the activity of all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals—that is, all multicellular animals except sponges and jellyfish. 

It is a structure composed of nervous tissue positioned along the rostral (nose end) to caudal (tail end) axis of the body and may have an enlarged section at the rostral end which is a brain. 

Not all animals with a central nervous system have a brain, although the large majority do.

The rest of this article exclusively discusses the vertebrate central nervous system, which is radically distinct from all other animals.


== Overview ==

In vertebrates the brain and spinal cord are both enclosed in the meninges. 

The meninges provide a barrier to chemicals dissolved in the blood, protecting the brain from most neurotoxins commonly found in food. 

Within the meninges the brain and spinal cord are bathed in cerebral spinal fluid which replaces the body fluid found outside the cells of all bilateral animals.

In vertebrates the CNS is contained within the dorsal body cavity, with the brain is housed in the cranial cavity within the skull, and the spinal cord is housed in the spinal canal within the vertebrae. 

Within the CNS, the interneuronal space is filled with a large amount of supporting non-nervous cells called neuroglia or glia from the Greek for "glue".

In vertebrates the CNS also includes the retina and the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), as well as the olfactory nerves and olfactory epithelium. 

As parts of the CNS, they connect directly to brain neurons without intermediate ganglia. 

The olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue outside the meninges in direct contact with the environment, which opens up a pathway for therapeutic agents which cannot otherwise cross the meninges barrier.


== Structure ==


The CNS consists of the two major structures: the brain and spinal cord. 

The brain is encased in the skull, and protected by the cranium. 

The spinal cord is continuous with the brain and lies caudally to the brain. 

It is protected by the vertebrae. 

The spinal cord reaches from the base of the skull, continues through or starting below the foramen magnum, and terminates roughly level with the first or second lumbar vertebra, occupying the upper sections of the vertebral canal.


=== White and gray matter ===


Microscopically, there are differences between the neurons and tissue of the CNS and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). 

The CNS is composed of white and gray matter. 

This can also be seen macroscopically on brain tissue. 

The white matter consists of axons and oligodendrocytes, while the gray matter consists of neurons and unmyelinated fibers. 

Both tissues include a number of glial cells (although the white matter contains more), which are often referred to as supporting cells of the CNS. 

Different forms of glial cells have different functions, some acting almost as scaffolding for neuroblasts to climb during neurogenesis such as bergmann glia, while others such as microglia are a specialized form of macrophage, involved in the immune system of the brain as well as the clearance of various metabolites from the brain tissue. 

Astrocytes may be involved with both clearance of metabolites as well as transport of fuel and various beneficial substances to neurons from the capillaries of the brain. 

Upon CNS injury astrocytes will proliferate, causing gliosis, a form of neuronal scar tissue, lacking in functional neurons.

The brain (cerebrum as well as midbrain and hindbrain) consists of a cortex, composed of neuron-bodies constituting gray matter, while internally there is more white matter that form tracts and commissures. 

Apart from cortical gray matter there is also subcortical gray matter making up a large number of different nuclei.


=== Spinal cord ===


From and to the spinal cord are projections of the peripheral nervous system in the form of spinal nerves (sometimes segmental nerves). 

The nerves connect the spinal cord to skin, joints, muscles etc. and allow for the transmission of efferent motor as well as afferent sensory signals and stimuli. 

This allows for voluntary and involuntary motions of muscles, as well as the perception of senses.

All in all 31 spinal nerves project from the brain stem, some forming plexa as they branch out, such as the brachial plexa, sacral plexa etc. 

Each spinal nerve will carry both sensory and motor signals, but the nerves synapse at different regions of the spinal cord, either from the periphery to sensory relay neurons that relay the information to the CNS or from the CNS to motor neurons, which relay the information out.

The spinal cord relays information up to the brain through spinal tracts through the final common pathway to the thalamus and ultimately to the cortex.

		


==== Cranial nerves ====

Apart from the spinal cord, there are also peripheral nerves of the PNS that synapse through intermediaries or ganglia directly on the CNS. 

These 12 nerves exist in the head and neck region and are called cranial nerves. 

Cranial nerves bring information to the CNS to and from the face, as well as to certain muscles (such as the trapezius muscle, which is innervated by accessory nerves as well as certain cervical spinal nerves).

Two pairs of cranial nerves; the olfactory nerves and the optic nerves are often considered structures of the CNS. 

This is because they do not synapse first on peripheral ganglia, but directly on CNS neurons. 

The olfactory epithelium is significant in that it consists of CNS tissue expressed in direct contact to the environment, allowing for administration of certain pharmaceuticals and drugs.


=== Brain ===


At the anterior end of the spinal cord lies the brain. 

The brain makes up the largest portion of the CNS. 

It is often the main structure referred to when speaking of the nervous system in general. 

The brain is the major functional unit of the CNS. 

While the spinal cord has certain processing ability such as that of spinal locomotion and can process reflexes, the brain is the major processing unit of the nervous system.


==== Brainstem ====

The brainstem consists of the medulla, the pons and the midbrain. 

The medulla can be referred to as an extension of the spinal cord, which both have similar organization and functional properties. 

The tracts passing from the spinal cord to the brain pass through here.Regulatory functions of the medulla nuclei include control of blood pressure and breathing. 

Other nuclei are involved in balance, taste, hearing, and control of muscles of the face and neck.

The next structure rostral to the medulla is the pons, which lies on the ventral anterior side of the brainstem. 

Nuclei in the pons include pontine nuclei which work with the cerebellum and transmit information between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex.

In the dorsal posterior pons lie nuclei that are involved in the functions of breathing, sleep, and taste.

The midbrain, or mesencephalon, is situated above and rostral to the pons. 

It includes nuclei linking distinct parts of the motor system, including the cerebellum, the basal ganglia and both cerebral hemispheres, among others. 

Additionally, parts of the visual and auditory systems are located in the midbrain, including control of automatic eye movements.

The brainstem at large provides entry and exit to the brain for a number of pathways for motor and autonomic control of the face and neck through cranial nerves, Autonomic control of the organs is mediated by the tenth cranial nerve. 

A large portion of the brainstem is involved in such autonomic control of the body. 

Such functions may engage the heart, blood vessels, and pupils, among others.The brainstem also holds the reticular formation, a group of nuclei involved in both arousal and alertness.


==== Cerebellum ====

The cerebellum lies behind the pons. 

The cerebellum is composed of several dividing fissures and lobes. 

Its function includes the control of posture and the coordination of movements of parts of the body, including the eyes and head, as well as the limbs. 

Further, it is involved in motion that has been learned and perfected through practice, and it will adapt to new learned movements.

Despite its previous classification as a motor structure, the cerebellum also displays connections to areas of the cerebral cortex involved in language and cognition. 

These connections have been shown by the use of medical imaging techniques, such as functional MRI and Positron emission tomography.

The body of the cerebellum holds more neurons than any other structure of the brain, including that of the larger cerebrum, but is also more extensively understood than other structures of the brain, as it includes fewer types of different neurons. 

It handles and processes sensory stimuli, motor information, as well as balance information from the vestibular organ.


==== Diencephalon ====

The two structures of the diencephalon worth noting are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. 

The thalamus acts as a linkage between incoming pathways from the peripheral nervous system as well as the optical nerve (though it does not receive input from the olfactory nerve) to the cerebral hemispheres. 

Previously it was considered only a "relay station", but it is engaged in the sorting of information that will reach cerebral hemispheres (neocortex).

Apart from its function of sorting information from the periphery, the thalamus also connects the cerebellum and basal ganglia with the cerebrum. 

In common with the aforementioned reticular system the thalamus is involved in wakefullness and consciousness, such as though the SCN.

The hypothalamus engages in functions of a number of primitive emotions or feelings such as hunger, thirst and maternal bonding. 

This is regulated partly through control of secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland. 

Additionally the hypothalamus plays a role in motivation and many other behaviors of the individual.


==== Cerebrum ====

The cerebrum of cerebral hemispheres make up the largest visual portion of the human brain. 

Various structures combine to form the cerebral hemispheres, among others: the cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala and hippocampus. 

The hemispheres together control a large portion of the functions of the human brain such as emotion, memory, perception and motor functions. 

Apart from this the cerebral hemispheres stand for the cognitive capabilities of the brain.

Connecting each of the hemispheres is the corpus callosum as well as several additional commissures.

One of the most important parts of the cerebral hemispheres is the cortex, made up of gray matter covering the surface of the brain. 

Functionally, the cerebral cortex is involved in planning and carrying out of everyday tasks.

The hippocampus is involved in storage of memories, the amygdala plays a role in perception and communication of emotion, while the basal ganglia play a major role in the coordination of voluntary movement.


=== Difference from the peripheral nervous system ===


This differentiates the CNS from the PNS, which consists of neurons, axons, and Schwann cells. 

Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells have similar functions in the CNS and PNS, respectively. 

Both act to add myelin sheaths to the axons, which acts as a form of insulation allowing for better and faster proliferation of electrical signals along the nerves. 

Axons in the CNS are often very short, barely a few millimeters, and do not need the same degree of isolation as peripheral nerves. 

Some peripheral nerves can be over 1 meter in length, such as the nerves to the big toe. 

To ensure signals move at sufficient speed, myelination is needed.
The way in which the Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes myelinate nerves differ. 

A Schwann cell usually myelinates a single axon, completely surrounding it. 

Sometimes, they may myelinate many axons, especially when in areas of short axons. 

Oligodendrocytes usually myelinate several axons. 

They do this by sending out thin projections of their cell membrane, which envelop and enclose the axon.


== Development ==


During early development of the vertebrate embryo, a longitudinal groove on the neural plate gradually deepens and the ridges on either side of the groove (the neural folds) become elevated, and ultimately meet, transforming the groove into a closed tube called the neural tube. 

The formation of the neural tube is called neurulation. 

At this stage, the walls of the neural tube contain proliferating neural stem cells in a region called the ventricular zone. 

The neural stem cells, principally radial glial cells, multiply and generate neurons through the process of neurogenesis, forming the rudiment of the CNS.The neural tube gives rise to both brain and spinal cord. 

The anterior (or 'rostral') portion of the neural tube initially differentiates into three brain vesicles (pockets): 
    the prosencephalon at the front, the mesencephalon, and, between the mesencephalon and the spinal cord, the rhombencephalon. 
    
(By six weeks in the human embryo) the prosencephalon then divides further into the telencephalon and diencephalon; and the rhombencephalon divides into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. 

The spinal cord is derived from the posterior or 'caudal' portion of the neural tube.

As a vertebrate grows, these vesicles differentiate further still. 

The telencephalon differentiates into, among other things, the striatum, the hippocampus and the neocortex, and its cavity becomes the first and second ventricles. 

Diencephalon elaborations include the subthalamus, hypothalamus, thalamus and epithalamus, and its cavity forms the third ventricle. 

The tectum, pretectum, cerebral peduncle and other structures develop out of the mesencephalon, and its cavity grows into the mesencephalic duct (cerebral aqueduct). 

The metencephalon becomes, among other things, the pons and the cerebellum, the myelencephalon forms the medulla oblongata, and their cavities develop into the fourth ventricle.

		


=== Evolution ===



==== Planaria ====

Planarians, members of the phylum Platyhelminthes (flatworms), have the simplest, clearly defined delineation of a nervous system into a CNS and a PNS.

Their primitive brains, consisting of two fused anterior ganglia, and longitudinal nerve cords form the CNS. 

Like vertebrates, have a distinct CNS and PNS. 

The nerves projecting laterally from the CNS form their PNS.

A molecular study found that more than 95% of the 116 genes involved in the nervous system of planarians, which includes genes related to the CNS, also exist in humans.


==== Arthropoda ====

In arthropods, the ventral nerve cord, the subesophageal ganglia and the supraesophageal ganglia are usually seen as making up the CNS. 

Arthropoda, unlike vertebrates, have inhibitory motor neurons due to their small size.


==== Chordata ====

The CNS of chordates differs from that of other animals in being placed dorsally in the body, above the gut and notochord/spine. 

The basic pattern of the CNS is highly conserved throughout the different species of vertebrates and during evolution. 

The major trend that can be observed is towards a progressive telencephalisation: 
    the telencephalon of reptiles is only an appendix to the large olfactory bulb, while in mammals it makes up most of the volume of the CNS. 

In the human brain, the telencephalon covers most of the diencephalon and the mesencephalon. 

Indeed, the allometric study of brain size among different species shows a striking continuity from rats to whales, and allows us to complete the knowledge about the evolution of the CNS obtained through cranial endocasts.


===== Mammals =====

Mammals – which appear in the fossil record after the first fishes, amphibians, and reptiles – are the only vertebrates to possess the evolutionarily recent, outermost part of the cerebral cortex known as the neocortex.

The neocortex of monotremes (the duck-billed platypus and several species of spiny anteaters) and of marsupials (such as kangaroos, koalas, opossums, wombats, and Tasmanian devils) lack the convolutions – gyri and sulci – found in the neocortex of most placental mammals (eutherians).

Within placental mammals, the size and complexity of the neocortex increased over time. 

The area of the neocortex of mice is only about 1/100 that of monkeys, and that of monkeys is only about 1/10 that of humans. 

In addition, rats lack convolutions in their neocortex (possibly also because rats are small mammals), whereas cats have a moderate degree of convolutions, and humans have quite extensive convolutions. 

Extreme convolution of the neocortex is found in dolphins, possibly related to their complex echolocation.


== Clinical significance ==



=== Diseases ===


There are many CNS diseases and conditions, including infections such as encephalitis and poliomyelitis, early-onset neurological disorders including ADHD and autism, late-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and essential tremor, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, genetic disorders such as Krabbe's disease and Huntington's disease, as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and adrenoleukodystrophy. 

Lastly, cancers of the central nervous system can cause severe illness and, when malignant, can have very high mortality rates. 

Symptoms depend on the size, growth rate, location and malignancy of tumors and can include alterations in motor control, hearing loss, headaches and changes in cognitive ability and autonomic functioning.

Specialty professional organizations recommend that neurological imaging of the brain be done only to answer a specific clinical question and not as routine screening.

SISTEMA NERVIOSO CENTRAL


El sistema nervioso central (SNC) es la parte del sistema nervioso que consiste principalmente en el cerebro y la médula espinal.

El SNC se llama así porque el cerebro integra la información recibida y coordina e influye en la actividad de todas las partes del cuerpo de los animales con simetría bilateral, es decir, todos los animales multicelulares excepto las esponjas y las medusas.

Es una estructura compuesta de tejido nervioso colocado a lo largo del eje rostral (extremo de la nariz) a caudal (extremo de la cola) del cuerpo y puede tener una sección agrandada en el extremo rostral que es un cerebro.

No todos los animales con sistema nervioso central tienen cerebro, aunque la gran mayoría sí.

El resto de este artículo trata exclusivamente del sistema nervioso central de los vertebrados, que es radicalmente distinto de todos los demás animales.


== Resumen ==

En los vertebrados, el cerebro y la médula espinal están encerrados en las meninges.

Las meninges proporcionan una barrera a los químicos disueltos en la sangre, protegiendo al cerebro de la mayoría de las neurotoxinas que se encuentran comúnmente en los alimentos.

Dentro de las meninges, el cerebro y la médula espinal están bañados en líquido cefalorraquídeo que reemplaza el líquido corporal que se encuentra fuera de las células de todos los animales bilaterales.

En los vertebrados, el SNC está contenido dentro de la cavidad dorsal del cuerpo, el cerebro está alojado en la cavidad craneal dentro del cráneo y la médula espinal está alojada en el canal espinal dentro de las vértebras.

Dentro del SNC, el espacio interneuronal está lleno de una gran cantidad de células no nerviosas de apoyo llamadas neuroglia o glía del griego para "pegamento".

En los vertebrados, el SNC también incluye la retina y el nervio óptico (nervio craneal II), así como los nervios olfatorios y el epitelio olfatorio.

Como partes del SNC, se conectan directamente a las neuronas cerebrales sin ganglios intermedios.

El epitelio olfativo es el único tejido nervioso central fuera de las meninges en contacto directo con el medio ambiente, lo que abre una vía para agentes terapéuticos que de otro modo no pueden cruzar la barrera de las meninges.


== Estructura ==


El SNC consta de dos estructuras principales: el cerebro y la médula espinal.

El cerebro está encerrado en el cráneo y protegido por el cráneo.

La médula espinal se continúa con el cerebro y se encuentra caudalmente al cerebro.

Está protegido por las vértebras.

La médula espinal se extiende desde la base del cráneo, continúa a través o comienza por debajo del agujero magno y termina aproximadamente al nivel de la primera o segunda vértebra lumbar, ocupando las secciones superiores del canal vertebral.


=== Sustancia blanca y gris ===


Microscópicamente, existen diferencias entre las neuronas y el tejido del SNC y el sistema nervioso periférico (SNP).

El SNC está compuesto de materia blanca y gris.

Esto también se puede ver macroscópicamente en el tejido cerebral.

La sustancia blanca está formada por axones y oligodendrocitos, mientras que la sustancia gris está formada por neuronas y fibras amielínicas.

Ambos tejidos incluyen varias células gliales (aunque la sustancia blanca contiene más), que a menudo se denominan células de soporte del SNC.

Las diferentes formas de células gliales tienen diferentes funciones, algunas actúan casi como un andamiaje para que los neuroblastos asciendan durante la neurogénesis, como la glía de Bergmann, mientras que otras, como la microglía, son una forma especializada de macrófagos, involucrada en el sistema inmunológico del cerebro, así como en la eliminación. de varios metabolitos del tejido cerebral.

Los astrocitos pueden participar tanto en la eliminación de metabolitos como en el transporte de combustible y varias sustancias beneficiosas a las neuronas desde los capilares del cerebro.

Tras la lesión del SNC, proliferarán los astrocitos, causando gliosis, una forma de tejido cicatricial neuronal, que carece de neuronas funcionales.

El cerebro (tanto el cerebro como el mesencéfalo y el rombencéfalo) consta de una corteza, compuesta de cuerpos neuronales que constituyen la materia gris, mientras que internamente hay más materia blanca que forma tractos y comisuras.

Además de la materia gris cortical, también existe la materia gris subcortical que forma un gran número de núcleos diferentes.


=== Médula espinal ===


Desde y hacia la médula espinal hay proyecciones del sistema nervioso periférico en forma de nervios espinales (a veces nervios segmentarios).

Los nervios conectan la médula espinal con la piel, las articulaciones, los músculos, etc. y permiten la transmisión de señales y estímulos motores eferentes y sensoriales aferentes.

Esto permite los movimientos voluntarios e involuntarios de los músculos, así como la percepción de los sentidos.

En total, 31 nervios espinales se proyectan desde el tronco encefálico, algunos forman plexos a medida que se ramifican, como el plexo braquial, el plexo sacro, etc.

Cada nervio espinal transportará señales sensoriales y motoras, pero los nervios hacen sinapsis en diferentes regiones de la médula espinal, ya sea desde la periferia a las neuronas transmisoras sensoriales que transmiten la información al SNC o desde el SNC a las neuronas motoras, que transmiten la información. afuera.

La médula espinal transmite información hasta el cerebro a través de los tractos espinales a través de la vía final común al tálamo y, en última instancia, a la corteza.

 


==== Nervios craneales ====

Aparte de la médula espinal, también hay nervios periféricos del SNP que hacen sinapsis a través de intermediarios o ganglios directamente en el SNC.

Estos 12 nervios existen en la región de la cabeza y el cuello y se denominan nervios craneales.

Los nervios craneales llevan información al SNC hacia y desde la cara, así como a ciertos músculos (como el músculo trapecio, que está inervado por nervios accesorios y ciertos nervios espinales cervicales).

Dos pares de nervios craneales; los nervios olfatorios y los nervios ópticos a menudo se consideran estructuras del SNC.

Esto se debe a que no hacen sinapsis primero en los ganglios periféricos, sino directamente en las neuronas del SNC.

El epitelio olfativo es significativo porque consiste en tejido del SNC que se expresa en contacto directo con el medio ambiente, lo que permite la administración de ciertos productos farmacéuticos y fármacos.


=== Cerebro ===


En el extremo anterior de la médula espinal se encuentra el cerebro.

El cerebro constituye la porción más grande del SNC.

A menudo es la estructura principal a la que se hace referencia cuando se habla del sistema nervioso en general.

El cerebro es la principal unidad funcional del SNC.

Si bien la médula espinal tiene cierta capacidad de procesamiento, como la locomoción espinal, y puede procesar reflejos, el cerebro es la principal unidad de procesamiento del sistema nervioso.


==== Tronco cerebral ====

El tronco encefálico está formado por el bulbo raquídeo, la protuberancia y el mesencéfalo.

Se puede hacer referencia a la médula como una extensión de la médula espinal, y ambas tienen una organización y propiedades funcionales similares.

Los tractos que van desde la médula espinal hasta el cerebro pasan por aquí. Las funciones reguladoras de los núcleos del bulbo raquídeo incluyen el control de la presión arterial y la respiración.

Otros núcleos están involucrados en el equilibrio, el gusto, la audición y el control de los músculos de la cara y el cuello.

La siguiente estructura rostral al bulbo raquídeo es la protuberancia, que se encuentra en el lado ventral anterior del tronco encefálico.

Los núcleos en la protuberancia incluyen núcleos pontinos que trabajan con el cerebelo y transmiten información entre el cerebelo y la corteza cerebral.

En la protuberancia dorsal posterior se encuentran núcleos que están involucrados en las funciones de respiración, sueño y gusto.

El mesencéfalo, o mesencéfalo, está situado por encima y rostral a la protuberancia.

Incluye núcleos que unen distintas partes del sistema motor, incluyendo el cerebelo, los ganglios basales y ambos hemisferios cerebrales, entre otros.

Además, partes de los sistemas visual y auditivo se encuentran en el mesencéfalo, incluido el control de los movimientos oculares automáticos.

El tronco encefálico en general proporciona entrada y salida al cerebro para una serie de vías para el control motor y autónomo de la cara y el cuello a través de los nervios craneales. El control autónomo de los órganos está mediado por el décimo nervio craneal.

Una gran parte del tronco del encéfalo está involucrada en dicho control autónomo del cuerpo.

Tales funciones pueden involucrar al corazón, los vasos sanguíneos y las pupilas, entre otros. El tronco encefálico también contiene la formación reticular, un grupo de núcleos involucrados tanto en la excitación como en el estado de alerta.


==== Cerebelo ====

El cerebelo se encuentra detrás de la protuberancia.

El cerebelo se compone de varias fisuras y lóbulos divisorios.

Su función incluye el control de la postura y la coordinación de movimientos de partes del cuerpo, incluidos los ojos y la cabeza, así como las extremidades.

Además, está involucrado en un movimiento que ha sido aprendido y perfeccionado a través de la práctica, y se adaptará a los nuevos movimientos aprendidos.

A pesar de su clasificación previa como estructura motora, el cerebelo también muestra conexiones con áreas de la corteza cerebral involucradas en el lenguaje y la cognición.

Estas conexiones se han demostrado mediante el uso de técnicas de imágenes médicas, como la resonancia magnética funcional y la tomografía por emisión de positrones.

El cuerpo del cerebelo contiene más neuronas que cualquier otra estructura del cerebro, incluida la del cerebro más grande, pero también se comprende más ampliamente que otras estructuras del cerebro, ya que incluye menos tipos de neuronas diferentes.

Maneja y procesa estímulos sensoriales, información motora, así como información de equilibrio del órgano vestibular.


==== Diencéfalo ====

Las dos estructuras del diencéfalo dignas de mención son el tálamo y el hipotálamo.

El tálamo actúa como enlace entre las vías entrantes del sistema nervioso periférico y del nervio óptico (aunque no recibe información del nervio olfatorio) a los hemisferios cerebrales.

Anteriormente se consideraba solo una "estación de retransmisión", pero se dedica a clasificar la información que llegará a los hemisferios cerebrales (neocorteza).

Aparte de su función de clasificar la información de la periferia, el tálamo también conecta el cerebelo y los ganglios basales con el cerebro.

Al igual que el sistema reticular antes mencionado, el tálamo está involucrado en la vigilia y la conciencia, como por ejemplo el SCN.

El hipotálamo participa en funciones de una serie de emociones o sentimientos primitivos, como el hambre, la sed y el vínculo materno.

Esto se regula en parte mediante el control de la secreción de hormonas de la glándula pituitaria.

Además, el hipotálamo juega un papel en la motivación y muchos otros comportamientos del individuo.


==== Cerebro ====

El cerebro de los hemisferios cerebrales constituye la porción visual más grande del cerebro humano.

Varias estructuras se combinan para formar los hemisferios cerebrales, entre otros: la corteza, los ganglios basales, la amígdala y el hipocampo.

Los hemisferios juntos controlan una gran parte de las funciones del cerebro humano, como la emoción, la memoria, la percepción y las funciones motoras.

Aparte de esto, los hemisferios cerebrales representan las capacidades cognitivas del cerebro.

Conectando cada uno de los hemisferios está el cuerpo calloso, así como varias comisuras adicionales.

Una de las partes más importantes de los hemisferios cerebrales es la corteza, formada por materia gris que cubre la superficie del cerebro.

Funcionalmente, la corteza cerebral está involucrada en la planificación y realización de las tareas cotidianas.

El hipocampo está involucrado en el almacenamiento de recuerdos, la amígdala juega un papel en la percepción y comunicación de las emociones, mientras que los ganglios basales juegan un papel importante en la coordinación del movimiento voluntario.


=== Diferencia del sistema nervioso periférico ===


Esto diferencia al SNC del SNP, que consta de neuronas, axones y células de Schwann.

Los oligodendrocitos y las células de Schwann tienen funciones similares en el SNC y el SNP, respectivamente.

Ambos actúan para agregar vainas de mielina a los axones, lo que actúa como una forma de aislamiento que permite una mejor y más rápida proliferación de señales eléctricas a lo largo de los nervios.

Los axones del SNC suelen ser muy cortos, apenas unos milímetros, y no necesitan el mismo grado de aislamiento que los nervios periféricos.

Algunos nervios periféricos pueden tener más de 1 metro de longitud, como los nervios del dedo gordo del pie.

Para garantizar que las señales se muevan a la velocidad suficiente, se necesita mielinización.
La forma en que las células de Schwann y los oligodendrocitos mielinizan los nervios difieren.

Una célula de Schwann suele mielinizar un solo axón, rodeándolo por completo.

A veces, pueden mielinizar muchos axones, especialmente cuando se encuentran en áreas de axones cortos.

Los oligodendrocitos suelen mielinizar varios axones.

Lo hacen enviando delgadas proyecciones de su membrana celular, que envuelven y encierran el axón.


== Desarrollo ==


Durante el desarrollo temprano del embrión vertebrado, un surco longitudinal en la placa neural se profundiza gradualmente y las crestas a cada lado del surco (los pliegues neurales) se elevan y finalmente se unen, transformando el surco en un tubo cerrado llamado tubo neural.

La formación del tubo neural se llama neurulación.

En esta etapa, las paredes del tubo neural contienen células madre neurales en proliferación en una región llamada zona ventricular.

Las células madre neurales, principalmente las células gliales radiales, se multiplican y generan neuronas a través del proceso de neurogénesis, formando el rudimento del SNC. El tubo neural da origen tanto al cerebro como a la médula espinal.

La porción anterior (o 'rostral') del tubo neural inicialmente se diferencia en tres vesículas cerebrales (bolsillos):
el prosencéfalo en la parte delantera, el mesencéfalo y, entre el mesencéfalo y la médula espinal, el rombencéfalo.
 
(A las seis semanas en el embrión humano) el prosencéfalo se divide aún más en telencéfalo y diencéfalo; y el rombencéfalo se divide en metencéfalo y mielencéfalo.

La médula espinal se deriva de la porción posterior o 'caudal' del tubo neural.

A medida que crece un vertebrado, estas vesículas se diferencian aún más.

El telencéfalo se diferencia, entre otras cosas, en cuerpo estriado, hipocampo y neocórtex, y su cavidad se convierte en el primer y segundo ventrículo.

Las elaboraciones del diencéfalo incluyen el subtálamo, el hipotálamo, el tálamo y el epitálamo, y su cavidad forma el tercer ventrículo.

El tectum, el pretectum, el pedúnculo cerebral y otras estructuras se desarrollan a partir del mesencéfalo, y su cavidad crece hacia el conducto mesencefálico (acueducto cerebral).

El metencéfalo se convierte, entre otras cosas, en la protuberancia y el cerebelo, el mielencéfalo forma el bulbo raquídeo y sus cavidades se desarrollan en el cuarto ventrículo.

 


=== Evolución ===



==== Planarias ====

Las planarias, miembros del filo Platyhelminthes (gusanos planos), tienen la delineación más simple y claramente definida de un sistema nervioso en un SNC y un SNP.

Sus cerebros primitivos, que consisten en dos ganglios anteriores fusionados y cordones nerviosos longitudinales, forman el SNC.

Al igual que los vertebrados, tienen un SNC y un SNP distintos.

Los nervios que se proyectan lateralmente desde el SNC forman su SNP.

Un estudio molecular encontró que más del 95% de los 116 genes involucrados en el sistema nervioso de las planarias, que incluye genes relacionados con el SNC, también existen en humanos.


==== Artrópodos ====

En los artrópodos, el cordón nervioso ventral, los ganglios subesofágicos y los ganglios supraesofágicos suelen formar parte del SNC.

Los artrópodos, a diferencia de los vertebrados, tienen neuronas motoras inhibitorias debido a su pequeño tamaño.


==== Datos de acordes ====

El SNC de los cordados se diferencia del de otros animales en que se ubica dorsalmente en el cuerpo, por encima del intestino y la notocorda/columna vertebral.

El patrón básico del SNC está muy conservado en las diferentes especies de vertebrados y durante la evolución.

La principal tendencia que se puede observar es hacia una telencefalización progresiva:
el telencéfalo de los reptiles es solo un apéndice del gran bulbo olfatorio, mientras que en los mamíferos constituye la mayor parte del volumen del SNC.

En el cerebro humano, el telencéfalo cubre la mayor parte del diencéfalo y el mesencéfalo.

De hecho, el estudio alométrico del tamaño del cerebro entre diferentes especies muestra una llamativa continuidad desde ratas hasta ballenas, y nos permite completar el conocimiento sobre la evolución del SNC obtenido a través de endomoldes craneales.


===== Mamíferos =====

Los mamíferos, que aparecen en el registro fósil después de los primeros peces, anfibios y reptiles, son los únicos vertebrados que poseen la parte más externa y evolutivamente reciente de la corteza cerebral conocida como neocorteza.

El neocórtex de los monotremas (el ornitorrinco de pico de pato y varias especies de osos hormigueros espinosos) y de los marsupiales (como los canguros, los koalas, las zarigüeyas, los wombats y los demonios de Tasmania) carecen de las circunvoluciones (circunvoluciones y surcos) que se encuentran en el neocórtex de la mayoría de las placentas. mamíferos (euterios).

Dentro de los mamíferos placentarios, el tamaño y la complejidad de la neocorteza aumentaron con el tiempo.

El área de la neocorteza de los ratones es solo alrededor de 1/100 de la de los monos, y la de los monos es solo alrededor de 1/10 de la de los humanos.

Además, las ratas carecen de circunvoluciones en su neocorteza (posiblemente también porque las ratas son mamíferos pequeños), mientras que los gatos tienen un grado moderado de circunvoluciones y los humanos tienen circunvoluciones bastante extensas.

La convolución extrema de la neocorteza se encuentra en los delfines, posiblemente relacionada con su ecolocación compleja.


== Importancia clínica ==



=== Enfermedades ===


Existen muchas enfermedades y afecciones del SNC, incluidas infecciones como la encefalitis y la poliomielitis, trastornos neurológicos de aparición temprana como el TDAH y el autismo, enfermedades neurodegenerativas de aparición tardía como la enfermedad de Alzheimer, la enfermedad de Parkinson y el temblor esencial, enfermedades autoinmunes e inflamatorias como la esclerosis y encefalomielitis diseminada aguda, trastornos genéticos como la enfermedad de Krabbe y la enfermedad de Huntington, así como la esclerosis lateral amiotrófica y la adrenoleucodistrofia.

Por último, los cánceres del sistema nervioso central pueden causar enfermedades graves y, cuando son malignos, pueden tener tasas de mortalidad muy altas.

Los síntomas dependen del tamaño, la tasa de crecimiento, la ubicación y la malignidad de los tumores y pueden incluir alteraciones en el control motor, pérdida de la audición, dolores de cabeza y cambios en la capacidad cognitiva y el funcionamiento autónomo.

Las organizaciones profesionales especializadas recomiendan que las imágenes neurológicas del cerebro se realicen solo para responder a una pregunta clínica específica y no como un examen de rutina.

SISTEMA NERVOSO CENTRAL


O sistema nervoso central (SNC) é a parte do sistema nervoso que consiste principalmente no cérebro e na medula espinhal.

O SNC é assim chamado porque o cérebro integra as informações recebidas e coordena e influencia a atividade de todas as partes dos corpos de animais bilateralmente simétricos – isto é, todos os animais multicelulares, exceto esponjas e águas-vivas.

É uma estrutura composta de tecido nervoso posicionado ao longo do eixo rostral (extremidade do nariz) a caudal (extremidade da cauda) do corpo e pode ter uma seção alargada na extremidade rostral que é um cérebro.

Nem todos os animais com sistema nervoso central têm cérebro, embora a grande maioria tenha.

O restante deste artigo discute exclusivamente o sistema nervoso central dos vertebrados, que é radicalmente distinto de todos os outros animais.


== Visão geral ==

Nos vertebrados, o encéfalo e a medula espinhal estão ambos envolvidos nas meninges.

As meninges fornecem uma barreira aos produtos químicos dissolvidos no sangue, protegendo o cérebro da maioria das neurotoxinas comumente encontradas nos alimentos.

Dentro das meninges, o cérebro e a medula espinhal são banhados em líquido cefalorraquidiano que substitui o fluido corporal encontrado fora das células de todos os animais bilaterais.

Nos vertebrados, o SNC está contido na cavidade dorsal do corpo, com o cérebro alojado na cavidade craniana dentro do crânio e a medula espinhal alojada no canal espinhal dentro das vértebras.

Dentro do SNC, o espaço interneuronal é preenchido com uma grande quantidade de células não nervosas de suporte chamadas neuróglia ou glia do grego para "cola".

Nos vertebrados, o SNC também inclui a retina e o nervo óptico (nervo craniano II), bem como os nervos olfatórios e o epitélio olfatório.

Como partes do SNC, eles se conectam diretamente aos neurônios cerebrais sem gânglios intermediários.

O epitélio olfativo é o único tecido nervoso central fora das meninges em contato direto com o meio ambiente, o que abre caminho para agentes terapêuticos que de outra forma não podem atravessar a barreira das meninges.


== Estrutura ==


O SNC consiste em duas estruturas principais: o encéfalo e a medula espinhal.

O cérebro está envolto no crânio e protegido pelo crânio.

A medula espinhal é contínua com o cérebro e situa-se caudalmente ao cérebro.

É protegido pelas vértebras.

A medula espinal vai da base do crânio, continua ou começa abaixo do forame magno e termina aproximadamente no nível da primeira ou segunda vértebra lombar, ocupando as seções superiores do canal vertebral.


=== Substância branca e cinzenta ===


Microscopicamente, existem diferenças entre os neurônios e tecidos do SNC e do sistema nervoso periférico (SNP).

O SNC é composto de substância branca e cinzenta.

Isso também pode ser visto macroscopicamente no tecido cerebral.

A substância branca consiste em axônios e oligodendrócitos, enquanto a substância cinzenta consiste em neurônios e fibras não mielinizadas.

Ambos os tecidos incluem várias células gliais (embora a substância branca contenha mais), que são frequentemente chamadas de células de suporte do SNC.

Diferentes formas de células gliais têm funções diferentes, algumas atuando quase como andaimes para os neuroblastos subirem durante a neurogênese, como a glia de bergmann, enquanto outras, como a microglia, são uma forma especializada de macrófago, envolvida no sistema imunológico do cérebro, bem como na depuração. de vários metabólitos do tecido cerebral.

Os astrócitos podem estar envolvidos tanto na depuração de metabólitos quanto no transporte de combustível e várias substâncias benéficas para os neurônios dos capilares do cérebro.

Após a lesão do SNC, os astrócitos proliferam, causando gliose, uma forma de tecido cicatricial neuronal, sem neurônios funcionais.

O cérebro (cérebro, bem como mesencéfalo e rombencéfalo) consiste em um córtex, composto de corpos de neurônios que constituem a matéria cinzenta, enquanto internamente há mais matéria branca que forma tratos e comissuras.

Além da substância cinzenta cortical, existe também a substância cinzenta subcortical que constitui um grande número de núcleos diferentes.


=== medula espinhal ===


De e para a medula espinhal são projeções do sistema nervoso periférico na forma de nervos espinhais (às vezes nervos segmentares).

Os nervos conectam a medula espinhal à pele, articulações, músculos etc. e permitem a transmissão de sinais e estímulos motores eferentes, bem como aferentes.

Isso permite movimentos voluntários e involuntários dos músculos, bem como a percepção dos sentidos.

Ao todo, 31 nervos espinhais se projetam do tronco cerebral, alguns formando plexos à medida que se ramificam, como o plexo braquial, o plexo sacral etc.

Cada nervo espinhal irá transportar sinais sensoriais e motores, mas os nervos fazem sinapse em diferentes regiões da medula espinhal, seja da periferia para neurônios de retransmissão sensoriais que retransmitem a informação para o SNC ou do SNC para neurônios motores, que retransmitem a informação. Fora.

A medula espinhal transmite informações para o cérebro através dos tratos espinhais através da via final comum para o tálamo e, finalmente, para o córtex.

 


==== Nervos cranianos ====

Além da medula espinhal, também existem nervos periféricos do SNP que fazem sinapse através de intermediários ou gânglios diretamente no SNC.

Esses 12 nervos existem na região da cabeça e pescoço e são chamados de nervos cranianos.

Os nervos cranianos trazem informações para o SNC de e para a face, bem como para certos músculos (como o músculo trapézio, que é inervado por nervos acessórios, bem como certos nervos espinhais cervicais).

Dois pares de nervos cranianos; os nervos olfatórios e os nervos ópticos são frequentemente considerados estruturas do SNC.

Isso ocorre porque eles não fazem sinapse primeiro nos gânglios periféricos, mas diretamente nos neurônios do SNC.

O epitélio olfativo é significativo, pois consiste em tecido do SNC expresso em contato direto com o meio ambiente, permitindo a administração de certos fármacos e drogas.


=== Cérebro ===


Na extremidade anterior da medula espinhal encontra-se o encéfalo.

O cérebro compõe a maior parte do SNC.

Muitas vezes, é a estrutura principal a que nos referimos quando se fala do sistema nervoso em geral.

O cérebro é a principal unidade funcional do SNC.

Embora a medula espinhal tenha certa capacidade de processamento, como a de locomoção espinhal, e possa processar reflexos, o cérebro é a principal unidade de processamento do sistema nervoso.


==== Tronco cerebral ====

O tronco encefálico consiste na medula, na ponte e no mesencéfalo.

A medula pode ser referida como uma extensão da medula espinhal, ambas com organização e propriedades funcionais semelhantes.

Os tratos que vão da medula espinhal ao cérebro passam por aqui. As funções reguladoras dos núcleos da medula incluem o controle da pressão sanguínea e da respiração.

Outros núcleos estão envolvidos no equilíbrio, paladar, audição e controle dos músculos da face e do pescoço.

A próxima estrutura rostral à medula é a ponte, que fica no lado ventral anterior do tronco encefálico.

Os núcleos na ponte incluem núcleos pontinos que trabalham com o cerebelo e transmitem informações entre o cerebelo e o córtex cerebral.

Na ponte posterior dorsal encontram-se núcleos que estão envolvidos nas funções de respiração, sono e paladar.

O mesencéfalo, ou mesencéfalo, está situado acima e rostral à ponte.

Inclui núcleos que ligam partes distintas do sistema motor, incluindo o cerebelo, os gânglios da base e ambos os hemisférios cerebrais, entre outros.

Além disso, partes dos sistemas visual e auditivo estão localizadas no mesencéfalo, incluindo o controle dos movimentos oculares automáticos.

O tronco cerebral em geral fornece entrada e saída para o cérebro para uma série de vias para o controle motor e autônomo da face e pescoço através dos nervos cranianos. O controle autônomo dos órgãos é mediado pelo décimo nervo craniano.

Uma grande parte do tronco cerebral está envolvida nesse controle autônomo do corpo.

Tais funções podem envolver o coração, vasos sanguíneos e pupilas, entre outros. O tronco cerebral também mantém a formação reticular, um grupo de núcleos envolvidos tanto na excitação quanto no estado de alerta.


==== Cerebelo ====

O cerebelo fica atrás da ponte.

O cerebelo é composto por várias fissuras e lobos divisores.

Sua função inclui o controle da postura e a coordenação dos movimentos de partes do corpo, incluindo os olhos e a cabeça, bem como os membros.

Além disso, está envolvido no movimento que foi aprendido e aperfeiçoado através da prática, e se adaptará aos novos movimentos aprendidos.

Apesar de sua classificação anterior como estrutura motora, o cerebelo também apresenta conexões com áreas do córtex cerebral envolvidas na linguagem e na cognição.

Essas conexões foram demonstradas pelo uso de técnicas de imagem médica, como ressonância magnética funcional e tomografia por emissão de pósitrons.

O corpo do cerebelo contém mais neurônios do que qualquer outra estrutura do cérebro, incluindo a do cérebro maior, mas também é mais amplamente compreendido do que outras estruturas do cérebro, pois inclui menos tipos de neurônios diferentes.

Ele lida e processa estímulos sensoriais, informações motoras, bem como informações de equilíbrio do órgão vestibular.


==== Diencéfalo ====

As duas estruturas do diencéfalo dignas de nota são o tálamo e o hipotálamo.

O tálamo atua como uma ligação entre as vias de entrada do sistema nervoso periférico, bem como o nervo óptico (embora não receba informações do nervo olfativo) para os hemisférios cerebrais.

Anteriormente era considerada apenas uma "estação de retransmissão", mas está engajada na triagem de informações que chegarão aos hemisférios cerebrais (neocórtex).

Além de sua função de classificar informações da periferia, o tálamo também conecta o cerebelo e os gânglios da base com o cérebro.

Em comum com o sistema reticular mencionado acima, o tálamo está envolvido na vigília e na consciência, como no SCN.

O hipotálamo se envolve em funções de uma série de emoções ou sentimentos primitivos, como fome, sede e vínculo materno.

Isso é regulado em parte pelo controle da secreção de hormônios da glândula pituitária.

Além disso, o hipotálamo desempenha um papel na motivação e em muitos outros comportamentos do indivíduo.


==== Cérebro ====

O cérebro dos hemisférios cerebrais compõem a maior porção visual do cérebro humano.

Várias estruturas se combinam para formar os hemisférios cerebrais, entre outros: o córtex, os gânglios da base, a amígdala e o hipocampo.

Os hemisférios juntos controlam uma grande parte das funções do cérebro humano, como emoção, memória, percepção e funções motoras.

Além disso, os hemisférios cerebrais representam as capacidades cognitivas do cérebro.

Conectando cada um dos hemisférios está o corpo caloso, bem como várias comissuras adicionais.

Uma das partes mais importantes dos hemisférios cerebrais é o córtex, composto de matéria cinzenta que cobre a superfície do cérebro.

Funcionalmente, o córtex cerebral está envolvido no planejamento e execução das tarefas cotidianas.

O hipocampo está envolvido no armazenamento de memórias, a amígdala desempenha um papel na percepção e comunicação da emoção, enquanto os gânglios da base desempenham um papel importante na coordenação do movimento voluntário.


=== Diferença do sistema nervoso periférico ===


Isso diferencia o SNC do SNP, que consiste em neurônios, axônios e células de Schwann.

Os oligodendrócitos e as células de Schwann têm funções semelhantes no SNC e no SNP, respectivamente.

Ambos atuam adicionando bainhas de mielina aos axônios, que atuam como uma forma de isolamento permitindo uma melhor e mais rápida proliferação de sinais elétricos ao longo dos nervos.

Os axônios no SNC são frequentemente muito curtos, apenas alguns milímetros, e não precisam do mesmo grau de isolamento que os nervos periféricos.

Alguns nervos periféricos podem ter mais de 1 metro de comprimento, como os nervos do dedão do pé.

Para garantir que os sinais se movam com velocidade suficiente, a mielinização é necessária.
A maneira pela qual as células de Schwann e os oligodendrócitos mielinizam os nervos diferem.

Uma célula de Schwann geralmente mieliniza um único axônio, envolvendo-o completamente.

Às vezes, eles podem mielinizar muitos axônios, especialmente quando em áreas de axônios curtos.

Os oligodendrócitos geralmente mielinizam vários axônios.

Eles fazem isso enviando finas projeções de sua membrana celular, que envolvem e envolvem o axônio.


== Desenvolvimento ==


Durante o desenvolvimento inicial do embrião vertebrado, um sulco longitudinal na placa neural se aprofunda gradualmente e as cristas em ambos os lados do sulco (as pregas neurais) tornam-se elevadas e finalmente se encontram, transformando o sulco em um tubo fechado chamado tubo neural.

A formação do tubo neural é chamada de neurulação.

Nesse estágio, as paredes do tubo neural contêm células-tronco neurais em proliferação em uma região chamada zona ventricular.

As células-tronco neurais, principalmente as células gliais radiais, multiplicam-se e geram neurônios através do processo de neurogênese, formando o rudimento do SNC. O tubo neural dá origem ao cérebro e à medula espinhal.

A porção anterior (ou 'rostral') do tubo neural inicialmente se diferencia em três vesículas cerebrais (bolsas):
o prosencéfalo na frente, o mesencéfalo e, entre o mesencéfalo e a medula espinhal, o rombencéfalo.
 
(Por seis semanas no embrião humano) o prosencéfalo então se divide em telencéfalo e diencéfalo; e o rombencéfalo se divide em metencéfalo e mielencéfalo.

A medula espinhal é derivada da porção posterior ou 'caudal' do tubo neural.

À medida que um vertebrado cresce, essas vesículas se diferenciam ainda mais.

O telencéfalo se diferencia, entre outras coisas, em estriado, hipocampo e neocórtex, e sua cavidade se torna o primeiro e o segundo ventrículos.

As elaborações do diencéfalo incluem o subtálamo, hipotálamo, tálamo e epitálamo, e sua cavidade forma o terceiro ventrículo.

O tecto, o pretectum, o pedúnculo cerebral e outras estruturas se desenvolvem a partir do mesencéfalo, e sua cavidade cresce no ducto mesencefálico (aqueduto cerebral).

O metencéfalo torna-se, entre outras coisas, a ponte e o cerebelo, o mielencéfalo forma a medula oblonga e suas cavidades se desenvolvem no quarto ventrículo.

 


=== Evolução ===



==== Planária ====

As planárias, membros do filo Platyhelminthes (vermes chatos), têm o delineamento mais simples e claramente definido de um sistema nervoso em SNC e SNP.

Seus cérebros primitivos, consistindo de dois gânglios anteriores fundidos e cordões nervosos longitudinais, formam o SNC.

Como os vertebrados, possuem SNC e SNP distintos.

Os nervos que se projetam lateralmente do SNC formam seu SNP.

Um estudo molecular descobriu que mais de 95% dos 116 genes envolvidos no sistema nervoso das planárias, que inclui genes relacionados ao SNC, também existem em humanos.


==== Artrópodes ====

Nos artrópodes, o cordão nervoso ventral, os gânglios subesofágicos e os gânglios supraesofágicos são geralmente vistos como constituindo o SNC.

Os artrópodes, ao contrário dos vertebrados, possuem neurônios motores inibitórios devido ao seu pequeno tamanho.


==== Cordados ====

O SNC dos cordados difere do de outros animais por ser colocado dorsalmente no corpo, acima do intestino e da notocorda/espinha.

O padrão básico do SNC é altamente conservado ao longo das diferentes espécies de vertebrados e durante a evolução.

A grande tendência que se observa é a de uma teleencefalização progressiva:
o telencéfalo dos répteis é apenas um apêndice do grande bulbo olfativo, enquanto nos mamíferos constitui a maior parte do volume do SNC.

No cérebro humano, o telencéfalo cobre a maior parte do diencéfalo e do mesencéfalo.

De fato, o estudo alométrico do tamanho do cérebro entre as diferentes espécies mostra uma continuidade marcante de ratos para baleias, e nos permite completar o conhecimento sobre a evolução do SNC obtido através de endocasts cranianos.


===== Mamíferos =====

Os mamíferos – que aparecem no registro fóssil após os primeiros peixes, anfíbios e répteis – são os únicos vertebrados a possuir a parte mais externa evolutivamente recente do córtex cerebral conhecida como neocórtex.

O neocórtex de monotremados (o ornitorrinco e várias espécies de tamanduás espinhosos) e de marsupiais (como cangurus, coalas, gambás, vombates e diabos da Tasmânia) carecem das circunvoluções – giros e sulcos – encontradas no neocórtex da maioria das placentas. mamíferos (eutérios).

Nos mamíferos placentários, o tamanho e a complexidade do neocórtex aumentaram ao longo do tempo.

A área do neocórtex dos camundongos é apenas cerca de 1/100 da dos macacos, e a dos macacos é apenas cerca de 1/10 da dos humanos.

Além disso, os ratos não têm circunvoluções em seu neocórtex (possivelmente também porque os ratos são pequenos mamíferos), enquanto os gatos têm um grau moderado de circunvoluções e os humanos têm circunvoluções bastante extensas.

Convolução extrema do neocórtex é encontrada em golfinhos, possivelmente relacionada à sua ecolocalização complexa.


== Significado clínico ==



=== Doenças ===


Existem muitas doenças e condições do SNC, incluindo infecções como encefalite e poliomielite, distúrbios neurológicos de início precoce, incluindo TDAH e autismo, doenças neurodegenerativas de início tardio, como doença de Alzheimer, doença de Parkinson e tremor essencial, doenças autoimunes e inflamatórias, como múltiplos esclerose e encefalomielite disseminada aguda, distúrbios genéticos como doença de Krabbe e doença de Huntington, bem como esclerose lateral amiotrófica e adrenoleucodistrofia.

Por fim, os cânceres do sistema nervoso central podem causar doenças graves e, quando malignos, podem ter taxas de mortalidade muito altas.

Os sintomas dependem do tamanho, taxa de crescimento, localização e malignidade dos tumores e podem incluir alterações no controle motor, perda auditiva, dores de cabeça e alterações na capacidade cognitiva e no funcionamento autonômico.

Organizações profissionais especializadas recomendam que imagens neurológicas do cérebro sejam feitas apenas para responder a uma questão clínica específica e não como triagem de rotina.

SYSTÈME NERVEUX CENTRAL


Le système nerveux central (SNC) est la partie du système nerveux composée principalement du cerveau et de la moelle épinière.

Le SNC est ainsi nommé parce que le cerveau intègre les informations reçues et coordonne et influence l'activité de toutes les parties du corps des animaux à symétrie bilatérale, c'est-à-dire tous les animaux multicellulaires à l'exception des éponges et des méduses.

C'est une structure composée de tissu nerveux positionné le long de l'axe rostral (nez) à caudal (queue) du corps et peut avoir une section élargie à l'extrémité rostrale qui est un cerveau.

Tous les animaux dotés d'un système nerveux central n'ont pas de cerveau, bien que la grande majorité en ait un.

Le reste de cet article traite exclusivement du système nerveux central des vertébrés, qui est radicalement distinct de tous les autres animaux.


== Aperçu ==

Chez les vertébrés, le cerveau et la moelle épinière sont tous deux enfermés dans les méninges.

Les méninges constituent une barrière contre les produits chimiques dissous dans le sang, protégeant le cerveau de la plupart des neurotoxines couramment présentes dans les aliments.

Dans les méninges, le cerveau et la moelle épinière baignent dans le liquide céphalo-rachidien qui remplace le liquide corporel trouvé à l'extérieur des cellules de tous les animaux bilatéraux.

Chez les vertébrés, le SNC est contenu dans la cavité corporelle dorsale, le cerveau est logé dans la cavité crânienne à l'intérieur du crâne et la moelle épinière est logée dans le canal rachidien à l'intérieur des vertèbres.

Au sein du SNC, l'espace interneuronal est rempli d'une grande quantité de cellules de soutien non nerveuses appelées névroglie ou glie du grec pour "colle".

Chez les vertébrés, le SNC comprend également la rétine et le nerf optique (nerf crânien II), ainsi que les nerfs olfactifs et l'épithélium olfactif.

En tant que parties du SNC, ils se connectent directement aux neurones du cerveau sans ganglions intermédiaires.

L'épithélium olfactif est le seul tissu nerveux central hors méninges en contact direct avec l'environnement, ce qui ouvre une voie aux agents thérapeutiques qui ne pourraient autrement franchir la barrière méningée.


== Structure ==


Le SNC est composé de deux structures principales : le cerveau et la moelle épinière.

Le cerveau est enfermé dans le crâne et protégé par le crâne.

La moelle épinière est continue avec le cerveau et se trouve caudalement au cerveau.

Il est protégé par les vertèbres.

La moelle épinière s'étend de la base du crâne, continue à travers ou commence en dessous du foramen magnum et se termine à peu près au niveau de la première ou de la deuxième vertèbre lombaire, occupant les sections supérieures du canal vertébral.


=== Matière blanche et grise ===


Au microscope, il existe des différences entre les neurones et les tissus du SNC et du système nerveux périphérique (SNP).

Le SNC est composé de matière blanche et grise.

Cela peut également être vu macroscopiquement sur le tissu cérébral.

La substance blanche est constituée d'axones et d'oligodendrocytes, tandis que la substance grise est constituée de neurones et de fibres non myélinisées.

Les deux tissus comprennent un certain nombre de cellules gliales (bien que la substance blanche en contienne plus), qui sont souvent appelées cellules de soutien du SNC.

Différentes formes de cellules gliales ont des fonctions différentes, certaines agissant presque comme un échafaudage pour que les neuroblastes grimpent pendant la neurogenèse comme la glie de Bergmann, tandis que d'autres comme la microglie sont une forme spécialisée de macrophage, impliquée dans le système immunitaire du cerveau ainsi que la clairance de divers métabolites du tissu cérébral.

Les astrocytes peuvent être impliqués à la fois dans la clairance des métabolites ainsi que dans le transport du carburant et de diverses substances bénéfiques vers les neurones à partir des capillaires du cerveau.

Lors d'une lésion du SNC, les astrocytes vont proliférer, provoquant une gliose, une forme de tissu cicatriciel neuronal, dépourvu de neurones fonctionnels.

Le cerveau (cerveau ainsi que mésencéphale et cerveau postérieur) est constitué d'un cortex, composé de corps neuronaux constituant la matière grise, tandis qu'à l'intérieur, il y a plus de matière blanche qui forme des voies et des commissures.

Outre la matière grise corticale, il existe également de la matière grise sous-corticale constituant un grand nombre de noyaux différents.


=== Moelle épinière ===


De et vers la moelle épinière se trouvent des projections du système nerveux périphérique sous la forme de nerfs rachidiens (parfois des nerfs segmentaires).

Les nerfs relient la moelle épinière à la peau, aux articulations, aux muscles, etc. et permettent la transmission du moteur efférent ainsi que des signaux et des stimuli sensoriels afférents.

Cela permet les mouvements volontaires et involontaires des muscles, ainsi que la perception des sens.

Au total, 31 nerfs rachidiens se projettent à partir du tronc cérébral, certains formant des plexa à mesure qu'ils se ramifient, tels que le plexa brachial, le plexa sacré, etc.

Chaque nerf spinal transmettra à la fois des signaux sensoriels et moteurs, mais les nerfs synapsent dans différentes régions de la moelle épinière, soit de la périphérie aux neurones relais sensoriels qui relaient l'information au SNC, soit du SNC aux motoneurones, qui relaient l'information. dehors.

La moelle épinière relaie les informations jusqu'au cerveau par le biais des voies vertébrales à travers la voie commune finale vers le thalamus et finalement vers le cortex.

 


==== Nerfs crâniens ====

Outre la moelle épinière, il existe également des nerfs périphériques du SNP qui synapsent par des intermédiaires ou des ganglions directement sur le SNC.

Ces 12 nerfs existent dans la région de la tête et du cou et sont appelés nerfs crâniens.

Les nerfs crâniens apportent des informations au système nerveux central vers et depuis le visage, ainsi qu'à certains muscles (comme le muscle trapèze, qui est innervé par des nerfs accessoires ainsi que certains nerfs rachidiens cervicaux).

Deux paires de nerfs crâniens ; les nerfs olfactifs et les nerfs optiques sont souvent considérés comme des structures du SNC.

En effet, ils ne synapsent pas d'abord sur les ganglions périphériques, mais directement sur les neurones du SNC.

L'épithélium olfactif est important en ce qu'il est constitué de tissu du SNC exprimé en contact direct avec l'environnement, permettant l'administration de certains produits pharmaceutiques et médicaments.


=== Cerveau ===


A l'extrémité antérieure de la moelle épinière se trouve le cerveau.

Le cerveau constitue la plus grande partie du SNC.

C'est souvent la structure principale à laquelle on se réfère lorsqu'on parle du système nerveux en général.

Le cerveau est la principale unité fonctionnelle du SNC.

Alors que la moelle épinière a certaines capacités de traitement telles que celle de la locomotion vertébrale et peut traiter les réflexes, le cerveau est la principale unité de traitement du système nerveux.


==== Tronc cérébral ====

Le tronc cérébral est constitué de la moelle, du pont et du mésencéphale.

La moelle épinière peut être considérée comme une extension de la moelle épinière, qui ont toutes deux une organisation et des propriétés fonctionnelles similaires.

Les voies passant de la moelle épinière au cerveau passent par ici. Les fonctions de régulation des noyaux médullaires comprennent le contrôle de la pression artérielle et de la respiration.

D'autres noyaux sont impliqués dans l'équilibre, le goût, l'ouïe et le contrôle des muscles du visage et du cou.

La prochaine structure rostrale à la moelle est le pons, qui se trouve sur la face antérieure ventrale du tronc cérébral.

Les noyaux du pont comprennent des noyaux pontiques qui travaillent avec le cervelet et transmettent des informations entre le cervelet et le cortex cérébral.

Dans les ponts postérieurs dorsaux se trouvent des noyaux impliqués dans les fonctions de respiration, de sommeil et de goût.

Le mésencéphale, ou mésencéphale, est situé au-dessus et rostral du pont.

Il comprend des noyaux reliant des parties distinctes du système moteur, notamment le cervelet, les ganglions de la base et les deux hémisphères cérébraux, entre autres.

De plus, certaines parties des systèmes visuel et auditif sont situées dans le mésencéphale, y compris le contrôle des mouvements oculaires automatiques.

Le tronc cérébral dans son ensemble fournit l'entrée et la sortie du cerveau pour un certain nombre de voies de contrôle moteur et autonome du visage et du cou par les nerfs crâniens. Le contrôle autonome des organes est médié par le dixième nerf crânien.

Une grande partie du tronc cérébral est impliquée dans ce contrôle autonome du corps.

De telles fonctions peuvent impliquer le cœur, les vaisseaux sanguins et les pupilles, entre autres. Le tronc cérébral contient également la formation réticulaire, un groupe de noyaux impliqués à la fois dans l'éveil et la vigilance.


==== Cervelet ====

Le cervelet se trouve derrière le pons.

Le cervelet est composé de plusieurs fissures et lobes de division.

Sa fonction comprend le contrôle de la posture et la coordination des mouvements des parties du corps, y compris les yeux et la tête, ainsi que les membres.

De plus, il est impliqué dans le mouvement qui a été appris et perfectionné par la pratique, et il s'adaptera aux nouveaux mouvements appris.

Malgré sa classification antérieure en tant que structure motrice, le cervelet présente également des connexions avec des zones du cortex cérébral impliquées dans le langage et la cognition.

Ces connexions ont été démontrées par l'utilisation de techniques d'imagerie médicale, telles que l'IRM fonctionnelle et la tomographie par émission de positrons.

Le corps du cervelet contient plus de neurones que toute autre structure du cerveau, y compris celle du plus grand cerveau, mais il est également mieux compris que les autres structures du cerveau, car il comprend moins de types de neurones différents.

Il gère et traite les stimuli sensoriels, les informations motrices, ainsi que les informations d'équilibre de l'organe vestibulaire.


==== Diencéphale ====

Les deux structures du diencéphale à noter sont le thalamus et l'hypothalamus.

Le thalamus agit comme un lien entre les voies entrantes du système nerveux périphérique ainsi que le nerf optique (bien qu'il ne reçoive pas d'entrée du nerf olfactif) vers les hémisphères cérébraux.

Auparavant, il n'était considéré que comme une "station relais", mais il est engagé dans le tri des informations qui atteindront les hémisphères cérébraux (néocortex).

Outre sa fonction de tri des informations en provenance de la périphérie, le thalamus relie également le cervelet et les ganglions de la base au cerveau.

En commun avec le système réticulaire susmentionné, le thalamus est impliqué dans l'éveil et la conscience, comme si le SCN.

L'hypothalamus s'engage dans les fonctions d'un certain nombre d'émotions ou de sentiments primitifs tels que la faim, la soif et les liens maternels.

Ceci est régulé en partie par le contrôle de la sécrétion d'hormones de la glande pituitaire.

De plus, l'hypothalamus joue un rôle dans la motivation et de nombreux autres comportements de l'individu.


==== Cerveau ====

Le cerveau des hémisphères cérébraux constitue la plus grande partie visuelle du cerveau humain.

Diverses structures se combinent pour former les hémisphères cérébraux, entre autres : le cortex, les ganglions de la base, l'amygdale et l'hippocampe.

Les hémisphères contrôlent ensemble une grande partie des fonctions du cerveau humain telles que l'émotion, la mémoire, la perception et les fonctions motrices.

En dehors de cela, les hémisphères cérébraux représentent les capacités cognitives du cerveau.

Reliant chacun des hémisphères est le corps calleux ainsi que plusieurs commissures supplémentaires.

L'une des parties les plus importantes des hémisphères cérébraux est le cortex, constitué de matière grise recouvrant la surface du cerveau.

Fonctionnellement, le cortex cérébral est impliqué dans la planification et l'exécution des tâches quotidiennes.

L'hippocampe est impliqué dans le stockage des souvenirs, l'amygdale joue un rôle dans la perception et la communication des émotions, tandis que les ganglions de la base jouent un rôle majeur dans la coordination des mouvements volontaires.


=== Différence avec le système nerveux périphérique ===


Cela différencie le SNC du SNP, qui se compose de neurones, d'axones et de cellules de Schwann.

Les oligodendrocytes et les cellules de Schwann ont des fonctions similaires dans le SNC et le SNP, respectivement.

Les deux agissent pour ajouter des gaines de myéline aux axones, ce qui agit comme une forme d'isolation permettant une prolifération meilleure et plus rapide des signaux électriques le long des nerfs.

Les axones du SNC sont souvent très courts, à peine quelques millimètres, et n'ont pas besoin du même degré d'isolement que les nerfs périphériques.

Certains nerfs périphériques peuvent mesurer plus d'un mètre de long, comme les nerfs du gros orteil.

Pour s'assurer que les signaux se déplacent à une vitesse suffisante, la myélinisation est nécessaire.
La façon dont les cellules de Schwann et les oligodendrocytes myélinisent les nerfs diffère.

Une cellule de Schwann myélinise généralement un seul axone, l'entourant complètement.

Parfois, ils peuvent myéliniser de nombreux axones, en particulier lorsqu'ils se trouvent dans des zones d'axones courts.

Les oligodendrocytes myélinisent généralement plusieurs axones.

Ils le font en envoyant de fines projections de leur membrane cellulaire, qui enveloppent et enferment l'axone.


== Développement ==


Au début du développement de l'embryon de vertébré, une rainure longitudinale sur la plaque neurale s'approfondit progressivement et les crêtes de chaque côté de la rainure (les plis neuraux) s'élèvent et finissent par se rejoindre, transformant la rainure en un tube fermé appelé tube neural.

La formation du tube neural est appelée neurulation.

À ce stade, les parois du tube neural contiennent des cellules souches neurales proliférantes dans une région appelée la zone ventriculaire.

Les cellules souches neurales, principalement les cellules gliales radiales, se multiplient et génèrent des neurones par le processus de neurogenèse, formant le rudiment du SNC. Le tube neural donne naissance à la fois au cerveau et à la moelle épinière.

La partie antérieure (ou «rostrale») du tube neural se différencie initialement en trois vésicules cérébrales (poches):
le prosencéphale à l'avant, le mésencéphale et, entre le mésencéphale et la moelle épinière, le rhombencéphale.
 
(À six semaines dans l'embryon humain), le prosencéphale se divise ensuite davantage en télencéphale et diencéphale; et le rhombencéphale se divise en métencéphale et myélencéphale.

La moelle épinière est dérivée de la partie postérieure ou «caudale» du tube neural.

Au fur et à mesure qu'un vertébré grandit, ces vésicules se différencient encore davantage.

Le télencéphale se différencie entre autres en striatum, hippocampe et néocortex, et sa cavité devient les premier et second ventricules.

Les élaborations du diencéphale comprennent le sous-thalamus, l'hypothalamus, le thalamus et l'épithalamus, et sa cavité forme le troisième ventricule.

Le tectum, le prétectum, le pédoncule cérébral et d'autres structures se développent à partir du mésencéphale et sa cavité se développe dans le canal mésencéphalique (aqueduc cérébral).

Le métencéphale devient, entre autres, le pont et le cervelet, le myélencéphale forme le bulbe rachidien et leurs cavités se développent dans le quatrième ventricule.

 


=== Évolution ===



==== Planaire ====

Les planaires, membres du phylum Plathelminthes (vers plats), ont la délimitation la plus simple et la plus clairement définie d'un système nerveux en un SNC et un SNP.

Leurs cerveaux primitifs, constitués de deux ganglions antérieurs fusionnés, et de cordons nerveux longitudinaux forment le SNC.

Comme les vertébrés, ont un SNC et un SNP distincts.

Les nerfs faisant saillie latéralement à partir du SNC forment leur SNP.

Une étude moléculaire a révélé que plus de 95% des 116 gènes impliqués dans le système nerveux des planaires, qui comprend des gènes liés au SNC, existent également chez l'homme.


==== Arthropodes ====

Chez les arthropodes, le cordon nerveux ventral, les ganglions sous-œsophagiens et les ganglions supra-œsophagiens sont généralement considérés comme constituant le SNC.

Les arthropodes, contrairement aux vertébrés, ont des motoneurones inhibiteurs en raison de leur petite taille.


==== Accords ====

Le SNC des cordés diffère de celui des autres animaux en ce qu'il est placé dorsalement dans le corps, au-dessus de l'intestin et de la notocorde / colonne vertébrale.

Le schéma de base du SNC est hautement conservé dans les différentes espèces de vertébrés et au cours de l'évolution.

La tendance majeure que l'on peut observer est à une télencéphalisation progressive :
le télencéphale des reptiles n'est qu'un appendice du gros bulbe olfactif, alors que chez les mammifères, il constitue l'essentiel du volume du SNC.

Dans le cerveau humain, le télencéphale couvre la majeure partie du diencéphale et du mésencéphale.

En effet, l'étude allométrique de la taille du cerveau chez différentes espèces montre une continuité frappante des rats aux baleines, et permet de compléter les connaissances sur l'évolution du SNC obtenues grâce aux endocastes crâniens.


===== Mammifères =====

Les mammifères - qui apparaissent dans les archives fossiles après les premiers poissons, amphibiens et reptiles - sont les seuls vertébrés à posséder la partie la plus externe et la plus récente du cortex cérébral, connue sous le nom de néocortex.

Le néocortex des monotrèmes (l'ornithorynque à bec de canard et plusieurs espèces de fourmiliers épineux) et des marsupiaux (tels que les kangourous, les koalas, les opossums, les wombats et les diables de Tasmanie) n'a pas les circonvolutions - gyri et sulci - trouvées dans le néocortex de la plupart des placentaires. mammifères (euthériens).

Chez les mammifères placentaires, la taille et la complexité du néocortex ont augmenté avec le temps.

La surface du néocortex des souris n'est que d'environ 1/100 de celle des singes, et celle des singes n'est que d'environ 1/10 de celle des humains.

De plus, les rats manquent de circonvolutions dans leur néocortex (peut-être aussi parce que les rats sont de petits mammifères), alors que les chats ont un degré modéré de circonvolutions et que les humains ont des circonvolutions assez étendues.

Une convolution extrême du néocortex se trouve chez les dauphins, peut-être liée à leur écholocation complexe.


== Signification clinique ==



=== Maladies ===


Il existe de nombreuses maladies et affections du système nerveux central, notamment des infections telles que l'encéphalite et la poliomyélite, des troubles neurologiques d'apparition précoce tels que le TDAH et l'autisme, des maladies neurodégénératives d'apparition tardive telles que la maladie d'Alzheimer, la maladie de Parkinson et les tremblements essentiels, des maladies auto-immunes et inflammatoires telles que la sclérose et l'encéphalomyélite aiguë disséminée, les troubles génétiques tels que la maladie de Krabbe et la maladie de Huntington, ainsi que la sclérose latérale amyotrophique et l'adrénoleucodystrophie.

Enfin, les cancers du système nerveux central peuvent provoquer des maladies graves et, lorsqu'ils sont malins, peuvent avoir des taux de mortalité très élevés.

Les symptômes dépendent de la taille, du taux de croissance, de l'emplacement et de la malignité des tumeurs et peuvent inclure des altérations du contrôle moteur, une perte auditive, des maux de tête et des modifications des capacités cognitives et du fonctionnement autonome.

Les organisations professionnelles spécialisées recommandent que l'imagerie neurologique du cerveau soit effectuée uniquement pour répondre à une question clinique spécifique et non comme un dépistage de routine.
